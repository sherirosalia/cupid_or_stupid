### Can music "play cupid"?

When it comes to compiling the ultimate playlist of the heart, the question arises: Are some music genres more romantic than others? 

### The recipe so far for sussing out the answer with data science:  
- Top romance playlists from Country, Hip Hop, Rap and Classics.
- Music lyric extraction with Python, courtesy of the GENIUS Developer API
-  Machine learning processing with the NLTK library to count word frequencies.


### "We've only just begun." 
This is the initial repository for a work in progress and contains:
- Temporary splash page where the song "Cupid Shuffle" can be viewed courtesy of Youtube.
