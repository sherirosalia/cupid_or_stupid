You\u2019re about to hear the story of the world\u2019s most notorious whistlebowers, from her perspective. But you won\u2019t hear her voice. You can\u2019t. This woman isn\u2019t allowed to talk to us because right now she\u2019s in a high security military prison. She serving 35 years for the biggest leak of military information in U.S. history. She\u2019s just 28 years old, but she\u2019s already endured months in military confinement, and is due to spend her adult life, in prison. Her name is Chelsea Manning.\n\nLet\u2019s rewind to 2009 for a second. Chelsea, or as she was then known, Private Bradley Manning, was serving in the U.S. Army in Iraq as a military analyst. Disturbed by some of the actions of U.S. forces and their allies, Chelsea made a decision that would have huge consequences. It would see her imprisoned, isolated, and sacrificing decades of her future. She blew the whistle.\n\nToday, Chelsea will tell you about who she is as a person, what she\u2019s been through, and what her life is like now.\n\nYou\u2019re listening to \u201cIn Their Own Words\u201d, a podcast series from Amnesty International that aims to get behind the headlines and hear from iconic human rights activists first hand. Since Chelsea\u2019s in military prison, barred from recording with us, actress Michelle Hendley is lending Chelsea her voice for this episode.\n\n[Chelsea Manning]\nI consider my home to be in the D.C. suburbs of Maryland\u2014that\u2019s Potomac, Rockville, Bethesda, and Silver Spring. But, Crescent, Oklahoma is the town that I lived in when I was very young.\n\nCrescent is a very small town\u2014probably hovering either just above or below a thousand people for the last thirty or so years. Right down the middle of it, there is about a mile or so long Main Street with a few old original Victorian era buildings \u2013 either occupied by businesses or abandoned\u2014on either side of it. The rest of the town is\u2014and has been for as long as I can remember\u2014mostly just streets with small houses or trailers. There are also a lot of churches\u2014and I do mean a lot\u2014I wouldn\u2019t dare try and give you an estimate as to the number.\n\nThe people of Crescent are often very friendly. Most of the people that lived there when I was growing up had been there for most of their lives. I would say that it was not uncommon for there to be kids \u2013 and sometimes even adults\u2014who had never left the state of Oklahoma. It\u2019s really just another one of those stereotypical \u201ceverybody knows everybody else\u201d\u2014kind of towns that crisscross the whole mid-western portion of the United States\u2014the portions that people\u2014like myself, sometimes\u2014call the \u201cflyover\u201d territory between the coasts.\n\nMy life was pretty rough. We lived in a small two-story house about three or so miles northwest of the center of Crescent. For about half of my time there, I lived with both my parents and my sister. After my sister graduated school in the mid-90s, she moved out\u2014coming back occasionally to live for short periods of time. My father traveled a lot\u2014 mostly business trips for the international company he worked for. So, for a lot of my childhood\u2014I spent time either with my sister or my mother. Unfortunately, both my parents drank heavily\u2014and they could both get erratic and abusive. My sister helped me with that a lot though. She was a great role model for me at a difficult time.\n\nI didn\u2019t have a lot of options and opportunities for interaction with people growing up\u2014so I naturally gravitated to computers because they were available to me when my mother was drunk, or my father was away, or when my sister wasn\u2019t at the house. I think my father allowed me on the computers as a replacement for him. So, I used them as a kind of babysitter and parent\u2014something to do without another person available.\n\nBy 1997\u2014when I was nine and ten years old\u2014I was exploring the internet a lot more, and began to hard code my own websites and put up useless information and facts on them. This was around about the time that I started using IRC chat rooms and began to communicate with other people on the Internet for the first time as well\u2014I was driven by a combination of curiosity and loneliness more than anything else.\n\nI remember not having anyone available to help me with my feelings. Like, when I was about eight, I confessed to a school counselor that I didn\u2019t know why I wanted to play with the girls, or play games like hopscotch or\u2026 whatever. I felt lonely and strange and I needed support. But, she didn\u2019t know what to do or say other than something along the lines of \u201cboys are different than girls\u201d and \u201cgirls do these things while boys do these other things.\u201d It was like there was nothing in-between.\n\nI didn\u2019t understand what was going on at all. I didn\u2019t have words to describe it. I just remember crying a lot and feeling weird. I felt like a freak.\n\nOther kids would pick up on things that I didn\u2019t quite understand. They would tease me a lot. \u201cHey, girly boy.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re so faggy.\u201d \u201cYou talk like a girl.\u201d \u201cYou walk like a little girl.\u201d \u201cYou cry a lot.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re so gay.\u201d It was a constant reminder of how different I was, and how little I understood the way people perceived me.\n\nI spent a lot of time trying to get into my sister\u2019s room. There was an arms race with locks. First she installed a hook and latch to keep me from opening the door. But, I would just get a stick to lift it up. She raised it, so I just got a bigger stick. Then she put on a simple lock\u2014so I learned how to pick it. Then I remember dad put an actual door lock on\u2014and I struggled for weeks to pick that lock. Eventually, though I figured out how to get in.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t a whole lot to it, really. I would just play with her old toys\u2014like Barbie dolls from the 1980s, and played with her clothing and stuff. I remember how neat and tidy she kept the room, and I wanted to be able to decorate my own room like she did. It was a very typical setup for a teenager in the early 1990s. She had a Rubik\u2019s cube and a lava lamp and black and white polka dot sheets. I played in her acid-washed jeans and leather jacket.\n\nBy the time I was about fifteen I was in a spiral of denial. I was struggling a lot. So, I would choose to ignore it. But, I couldn\u2019t ignore it. I would spend weeks ignoring these feelings\u2014and then splurge on them. I lived in Southwest Wales in the U.K. back then, and I would buy makeup and girl\u2019s clothes at a thrift store\u2014sneaking around like a kid trying to buy cigarettes or alcohol underage. I would wear the stuff for a bit and then throw it into a trash bag and throw it in a dumpster down the street in the orange glow of the street lights on misty nights. Then I would repeat the cycle a few weeks later.\n\nMy inner thoughts were just unhealthy\u2014internalized repeats of the taunts and bad advice from earlier in my life. You\u2019re a freak. Nobody loves you. You\u2019re such a girly weirdo. Man up. These were tough times for me, certainly.\n\nI started talking to my friends before I moved to Wales from Oklahoma. I was mostly just asking questions like\u2014is it normal for me to feel like I am a girl, or that I feel attracted to guys? Does anyone else feel compelled to wear girls\u2019 clothing on occasions? But, it would end in disaster for me. People would be shocked by the questions\u2014and I would suffer the consequences of my honesty in the rumors and slander that I would hear in school in the days following. I would deny everything and go into hiding for a couple of weeks until everybody forgot.\n\nSo, it turns out that these reactions would keep me in the closet for a very long time\u2014especially for people who were the closest to me. But, when I was more anonymous\u2014online, or far away from home in a city or while traveling on the train or a bus\u2014then, I felt more comfortable to be honest, and to explore my identity.\n\nI could be anyone I wanted to be online. The rules of the world didn\u2019t seem to apply. In that era you identified yourself as a handle and your \u201cASL\u201d \u2013 age, sex, and location. You didn\u2019t have to be honest. I could be 16, female, and from Houston, Texas\u2014or I could be 24, male, and from London, England. It required a lot of imagination\u2014and a discipline for creating consistency if you were trying to be convincing to an online crowd. I was more myself than I could ever be \u201cIRL\u201d\u2014in real life\u2014as it was described online.\n\nI was running away from the world that I lived in and experienced every day. I often felt like a stranger, or like an observer in my daily life. Sitting in my room, at night, illuminated by the light of the monitor in the dark I felt like I could type my innermost thoughts and feelings to people that I didn\u2019t know, in a completely made up universe. It was a universe where you could be anyone that you ever wanted to be. It was both a fascinating and liberating experience for me growing up.\n\nAlthough there wasn\u2019t a huge trans community presence on the internet yet\u2014during the early 2000s searching the term \u201ctransgender\u201d would still get you a lot of pornography sites\u2014but there was a thriving gay community which I was able to identify with and feel at home talking to. I made a lot of friends online. These were people who I knew very intimately even without knowing their names or what they looked like. The early internet was a very powerful anonymizer.\n\nThe first time I passed as a woman in public was while I was on leave from my deployment to Iraq, in 2010. I was dressed in a casual gray business suit jacket and skirt with a white blouse, black tights and a faded purple coat\u2014it was really cold outside \u2013 and business shoes. I just kind of wandered about in public. I went to coffee shops and book stores and just tried to blend in as a bored woman looking for something interesting to do.\n\nAnd, I was amazed at how much it worked, and how human and normal that it felt for me. I didn\u2019t have the confidence before, and never would have done such a thing before I deployed to the combat zone of Iraq. But, I felt that it went pretty amazing. I was very disappointed to have to leave.\n\nAfter leaving the U.K. in 2005, I moved in with my father and his new wife at the time. I was starting to explore my sexuality like a normal teenager should. But, his wife really didn\u2019t like me and we had many disputes, and she didn\u2019t like the fact that I even existed. After she called the police on me, I left the house and didn\u2019t really have anywhere to go. So, I borrowed my father\u2019s small red pickup truck and wandered around the Midwest for a few months and settled in Chicago for the summer.\n\nIt was a very annoying experience for me. I had no resources available to me. Volunteer homeless shelters were very anti-gay and anti-trans and required you to attend prayer ceremonies so I avoided those. I ended up sleeping in the truck a lot.\n\nEvery other night I would wake up with a flashlight in my face. I would squint at a police officer or a sheriff\u2019s deputy with the red and blue flashing lights of a police car behind them.\n\nSometimes they would start yelling at me, pulling me out of the car. They would yell things like \u201cDon\u2019t move freak!\u201d or \u201cGive me a reason to shoot you, scumbag!\u201d I would sometimes sit in handcuffs behind me on the curb of a street, or the dewy grass of a drainage ditch and get questioned on whether I had any warrants out for my arrest, or if I had drugs, or if I was soliciting for prostitution, or\u2014whatever\u2026 I was just a street kid to them. But, after every time of harassment \u2013 whether minutes or hours \u2013 they would let me go. I expected to go to jail for something eventually, but I didn\u2019t. Unfortunately, it\u2019s a typical experience for many queer and trans youth even today.\n\nI was really starting to struggle with my gender identity in the spring of 2007\u2014and I even started seeing a therapist to talk about it, but I never had the courage to talk to her about my struggle. I was very lonely and afraid.\n\nThe war in Iraq was entering the troop \u201csurge\u201d that summer, and it was on television every night. I started to wonder about whether or not I could make a difference if the war kept spiraling out of control. I felt like my country needed me, and so I started asking my father about how to enlist in the military. He recommended I talk to a Navy or Air Force recruiter\u2014but I wasn\u2019t interested in joining either the Navy or the Air Force.\n\nBut, when I came home from work at night and watched the evening news, I saw all of these soldiers running around Baghdad and Basra, Iraq, and I felt that more ground forces were what the military really needed. I also felt that maybe the Army would \u201cman\u201d me up, so to speak, by instilling certain expectations on me so that I would be more masculine. So, I started talking to an Army recruiter and signed up. After saying some quick and emotional goodbyes to my family, I officially enlisted in the Army on the first day of October 2007, and reported to basic training the next morning.\n\nI hoped that I could help to bring as many of the soldiers that were sent to Iraq and Afghanistan home, and to protect the civilians that were stuck living in these countries at the time. I felt that maybe if I did my job really well, I could really maximize our ability to know and understand insurgencies and conducting counterinsurgency strategies to speed things up. I was pretty hopeful that we could still make a difference there.\n\nDuring the first week of training, one of the drill sergeants who inventoried my personal belongings made comments about my phone. It was a bold, fuchsia tone of hot pink that I loved. It never occurred to me not to bring it with me. It was pretty humiliating for me among the other recruits for a couple of days before training went on as normal.\n\nMy role as an all-source intelligence analyst was to take all of the various types of information\u2014what might sometimes get called \u201craw intelligence\u201d\u2014that get gathered from different sources\u2014or \u201cdisciplines\u201d\u2014such as interrogation reports, or observation reports, or intercepted communications, or satellite imagery, and to look at each different type and combine them together to produce reports or\u2014 all too often \u2013 slide shows.\n\nWhile I was deployed I worked between 12 to 14 hours a day every day of the week\u2014without any full days off. I also worked the night shift most of the time I was in Iraq, this was when most of the logistics, training and combat operations would happen, so it would be busy with a lot of pressure on us throughout the shift. There would often be forty to a hundred e-mails for me to go through each night\u2014very intense and high stakes.\n\nMy time off was short, but I would often have trouble sleeping\u2014especially with the sun beaming outside and the constant roar of generators and people passing by my trailer. I often spent a lot of my time online with my laptop\u2014when I could get a decent internet connection, of course. I also listened to a lot of music. I didn\u2019t talk to very many people after awhile. I was really starting to struggle with the weight of people dying around me every day, and trying to fit into this projected persona of being a \u201cman.\u201d I was very anxious and often depressed.\n\nI was inundated with all these numbers and reports and coordinates and names and pictures! It became overwhelming after awhile. At some point, the work that I did stopped feeling like an abstract and intellectual chore, and began to become very real. These were real people living in real places. When we made mistakes planning operations, innocent people died. When we failed to see the small scale and the big picture as being connected, then our operations wouldn\u2019t flow very well and innocent people would get caught up in detention for weeks or years because of a minor mistake that we made.\n\nIt often became a burden for me when we made mistakes or overlooked things like the Iraqi government detaining people under false pretenses, and torturing their citizens because they wanted to make an example. A part of me still takes their suffering personally.\n\n[Recording: Voice of Amy Goodman on \u2018Democracy Now\u2019 from an April 6th 2010 news bulletin:]\n\u201cThe US Military has confirmed the authenticity of newly released video showing US forces indiscriminately firing on Iraqi civilians.\n\nOn Monday the website WikiLeaks.org posted footage taken from a US military helicopter in July 2007 as it killed 12 people and wounded 2 children. The voices on the tape appear to believe their targets are carrying weapons, but the footage unmistakably shows some of the victims holding camera equipment. The dead included two employees of the Reuters news agency.\n\nThe pentagon has never publicly released the footage and has previously cleared those involved of wrong-doing. WikiLeaks says it managed to de-encrypt the tape after receiving it from a confidential source inside the military who wanted the story to be known.\u201d[Chelsea Manning]\nThe consequences did feel very vague at the time. A discharge from the military sounded bad. A couple of years in prison sounded like a lifetime to me then. I expected the worst possible outcomes, but I didn\u2019t have a strong or concrete sense of what that might have entailed.\n\nIn the abstract, I expected to be demonized and scrutinized. I expected to have every moment of my life examined for every single possible screw up that I\u2019ve ever made, for every flaw and blemish that I have, and to have them be used against me in the court of public opinion. I was especially afraid that my gender identity would be used against me and other people who suffered like I did. Looking back, I think that my fears were based in reality.\n\n[Host]\nChelsea was arrested by the US Army\u2019s Criminal investigation team on May 27th 2010. Four days later, she was transferred to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait, where she would spend the next two months in solitary confinement.\n\n[Chelsea Manning]\nI didn\u2019t have any clue how I would be treated. At first everything seemed pretty normal. I was living with other people in a tent for a couple of days. It wasn\u2019t until I was placed in maximum custody in what was basically this large metal cage within a tent that things really got bad. I expected to be treated like any other military prisoner or detainee would be\u2014with dignity and respect, I had no reason to expect otherwise until I was transferred to the cage.\n\nIt was very hot, and it was dark in the tent. I remember you couldn\u2019t tell If it was day or night outside. The facility operated 24/7 so only the meals would give you a hint as to what time it was. Eventually, it all became a blur. It\u2019s difficult to for me to explain in any detail.\n\nMy memory of that time is very foggy. It\u2019s all blended together as a really personal mess.\n\nBeing alone in that tent for hours on end without having any access to the outside world, I was left without any Idea of what was going on anywhere. I barely knew what month it was, or how long I had been there. I hadn\u2019t started talking regularly to an attorney yet, and I didn\u2019t even know what I was being charged with, exactly, either.\n\nAfter a few weeks of living in this mental blur\u2014I began to become entirely dependent on the staff that came to watch me and deliver food to me. They were my only connection to the outside world. But, they were not very talkative or reliable \u2013 at least in retrospect. My mind was very malleable and I was susceptible to believing all kinds of things because I didn\u2019t have any other information. So\u2014if a guard told me that I was going to be transferred to a ship off the coast of the horn of Africa, it made sense to me and I totally believed it was possible. I had no idea if the rest of the world knew where I was, or where I was going. Anything could have happened.\n\nWhen I arrived at Marine Corps Base Quantico I was basically subjected to the same conditions that I was in Kuwait\u2014except it was a permanent, air-conditioned building in Virginia. After being there for a couple of days I was allowed to have visitors which was very helpful to catching up on what had happened in the two or three months prior.\n\nI lived in a small 8 by 6 feet Cell\u2014roughly 2.5 by 2 meters. I was in a cell-block with a bunch of other cells that were all empty. I was not allowed to talk to anyone else \u2013 even though there wasn\u2019t anybody near me. There were at least two Marines that watched me from behind a one-way reflective glass window at all times. I could see myself in the reflection of the window ail day long. It was like a mirror right outside my cell.\n\nI was not allowed to have anything in my cell that I wasn\u2019t actually using. I would turn in most of my clothes at night. If I wanted to use the toilet, I had to ask for toilet paper, and I would have to return it when I was done. It was the same with toothbrushes, books, and sometimes even my glasses. I was not allowed to lie down or sleep during the duty day from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. I was only allowed to sit up straight on my bed and literally stare at the wall for hours on end. I was sometimes allowed to watch television during the evening, but I had no control over what was on. Even then, Marines would monitor what I was watching, and would change the channel when anything like news or current events shows would come on.\n\nThe entire experience was such a surreal nightmare\u2014it just seemed comical to me. I mean, it was just an incredibly crazy experience. It just seems that you have to have a sense of humor in these kinds of situations, or else you won\u2019t be able to cope with painful or emotionally complicated situations.\n\nI viewed the junior enlisted Marines who watched me and escorted me to the shower and to the recreation pen every day as just being young people who were doing their job. Most of the younger ones were very recently out of high school\u2014some with as little as 3 to 6 months in the Marine Corps. I didn\u2019t really interact with anyone else, so I never really developed an impression of the more senior people Involved.\n\nThe conditions in my cell were far beyond what is normally associated with solitary confinement. I needed permission to do anything in my cell. I was not allowed to move around the cell to exercise. I was not allowed to sit down with my back against the wall. I had no possessions inside the cell except when I was actually using something. I mean, I had a guard watch me brush my teeth every morning. The rules just seemed crazy.\n\n[Host]\nAfter more than three years of confinement, on the 21 August 2013, Private Chelsea Manning was sentenced to 35 years in military prison for passing classified documents to WikiLeaks during 2009 and 2010. During her trial, she was banned from presenting her evidence or the motives behind her actions, including her claim that she was acting in the public interest in exposing military abuses.\n\nWe asked Chelsea what happened in the moments after the verdict.\n\n[Chelsea Manning]\nMy legal team were pretty upset. We were escorted into a tiny side room immediately after the hearing closed. There were six of us in this small room with white walls and no furniture, with two of the armed security guards at the door waiting until the courtroom was cleared. There was this ominous silence except for a sniffle from one of the lawyers who started to cry. It seemed that everyone in the room was afraid to speak, so I just started speaking. I began telling them that they did a great job and worked very, very hard to get to this point\u2014and that I couldn\u2019t have asked for anything more from them.\n\n\u201cWhy did I publicly announce \u2018I am Chelsea Manning, I am female.\u2019 the day after the sentence?\u201d Well\u2014for one\u2014that\u2019s who I am. It made sense to me to tell people who I am as soon as I was given the opportunity to do so, which was the day after the trial finished. I had been holding back on my announcement only because of the trial. I wanted to do it sooner, but the lawyers advised against it.\n\nI felt honored to have a platform like national television available to me to make such an announcement. I felt proud of myself, for making the decision to be honest about who I am with everyone I know. I also felt excited, because I was getting nothing but an outpouring of support from the people who care about me.\n\nFort Leavenworth Is a very large but not a very densely populated military base in the rolling hills along the Kansas banks of the Missouri River. It\u2019s known for two things: the command and staff school that teaches military officers from all over the world; and, the military prison.\n\nMy initial impressions were based on the old \u201ccastle\u201d prison building that has been closed down for several years now. I was expecting something from the movies. The reality is a lot simpler.\n\nOn my first night here, I was pretty much like \u201cOkay, here I am.\u201d I laid looking up in the dark of my cell and I stared at this dim buzzing night light on that ceiling, and I decided to just blend in and work toward settling in here.\n\nEvery single morning when I wake up, I walk over to the stainless steel toilet/sink in my cell and look into the eyes of the woman in the reflection in the mirror and say \u201cokay, you can deal with this\u201d to her. That\u2019s the moment each morning that I motivate myself for the day\u2014and only that day. I think its very important to break big long things like years down into discrete and manageable units that can easily be conquered.\n\nIn here, I\u2019m just like anybody else. There\u2019s nothing special about me in comparison to anyone else who lives here. I get treated like anyone else, and I only expect that I get treated like anyone else.\n\nI wake up at around 4:30 a.m. each work day, or about 5:30 on weekends and holidays.\n\nWhen I\u2019m working, I drink coffee and eat breakfast at the prison cafeteria\u2014when I\u2019m not working, I avoid coffee and take a nap after breakfast \u2014ha-ha. Work begins at about 7 a.m. and lasts until about 4 p.m., with about an hour and a half break for lunch in between.\n\nWhen I get back to my cell in the evening, I go through the letters, cards, newspapers, and magazines from the day. I sometimes sort my laundry, get ready to either work out (with an emphasis on flexibility and cardio), or go to the Library to exchange books or type up letters or legal documents. I also make the most of my phone calls in the evening. I take a shower after working out, and go to bed\u2014usually after reading a book or a magazine for an hour or so.\n\nI work in a small woodwork team and we make a lot of high quality items. When we are lucky, we might make heirloom furniture for special orders\u2014coffee-tables, beds, dressers, and cabinets. But we make a lot of standard stock items for bulk orders\u2014usually odds and ends like award plaques, picture frames, picture boards, and triangular flag cases for folded U.S. flags. It\u2019s a very fun job. Each team makes these items from start to finish\u2014from rough lumber to the final finished product\u2014so it feels like we\u2019re making something out of nothing on our own. It\u2019s not an assembly line.\n\nIt\u2019s the dead heat of summer right now, so I can see the sky outside my window. It often swings wildly from an incredible clear azure hue of blue, to the ominous rolling of puffy white thunderstorm clouds from the distance, to the dark gray swirl of an intense Midwestern storm with flashes of bright white and blue lightning. There are fields of grass outside and between the fence that are very green and healthy\u2014with a large variety of birds and little critters like squirrels and bugs running amok in them. I can also see the vast, rolling hills and thick patches of hardwood trees typical of northeastern Kansas and western Missouri.\n\nIn winter, everything turns a deep golden brown\u2014the trees, the grass, the dirt, basically everything. As it begins to look really bland, nature throws in a light snow storm to the mix, and everything gets blanketed with a bright and very pure white! It\u2019s never dull outside my window.\n\nBut sure, there are less exciting things like buildings and razor wire\u2014but my mind doesn\u2019t register them anymore.\n\nI love doing cardio and flexibility exercises\u2014and in spring, early summer, and early autumn I get to go outside and run. Right now, It\u2019s the dead heat of summer and It\u2019s just too hot and humid to run all that much\u2014but as soon as it starts to cool off, I\u2019ll get back into the rhythm.\n\nI requested for medical treatment in August 2013\u2014but I didn\u2019t start treatment until February 2015. In December of 2014, I started wearing cosmetics\u2014but that was really just a Band-Aid.\n\nIt\u2019s a very strange reality that taking hormones has made clear to me. I can feel emotions much more immediately and deeply. Before, I used to just put my feelings in this little box in my head and say\u2014I\u2019ll deal with you later. But now, when I\u2019m feeling sad, I cry. When I\u2019m feeling angry, I need to take a step away and cool down for a minute. When I\u2019m feeling happy, I laugh and get excited\u2014and when I\u2019m feeling lonely, I reach out to someone that I care about. Life Is a much richer and fuller experience for me as a person.\n\nPhysically, my skin is softer and I guess that it\u2019s a lot more sensitive because I can feel things that I never noticed before\u2014like the way that the texture of fabrics might run against my skin, or the air circulating through my clothing, or the smooth and intense cold of a door handle. These feelings are very real to me\u2014and I wouldn\u2019t want to get rid of them.\n\nI\u2019m committed to learning as much as I can. I have a lot of little goals and objectives that I set for myself every day and every week, like writing this essay for a college course, or reading about this particular topic, or focusing on learning a particular style or technique of doing something. But, as a whole they all coalesce into the goal of enriching my knowledge, understanding, and connection with the world and people around me.\n\nI have always enjoyed music. I love all different kinds of music \u2013 but I have a particular taste for what a lot people call \u201cE.D.M.\u201d or \u201celectronic dance music.\u201d But more fundamentally, I love any music that has a good beat \u2013 it\u2019s just I prefer the creativity that digital and electronic music can offer us. I think it\u2019s a fantastic medium to work with and listen to!\n\nI get the most hope from the letters and cards that I receive from all kinds of unique people. I get letters from queer and trans kids a lot\u2014which I think is amazing just because it\u2019s a long forgotten medium to write a letter. When I first entered into confinement, I didn\u2019t know where to write the return address or the sending address or where to put a stamp\u2014so I can only imagine how important it must be for a kid to learn how to do something so unusual and unfamiliar in this digital era. It means a lot for me to get letters from these kids who feel so connected with me \u2013 they inspire me to keep going, and give me the most amount of hope.\n\nI\u2019ve actually imagined a few times what it would be like if I could travel back in time and speak to myself as a teenager. I know what she was feeling deep down inside. I know all the fears that she had, and all the vulnerabilities she was hiding. I would want to grab her by the hand and tell her that everything is going to be okay. I would tell her that there is nothing wrong with you, and that you are more loved and appreciated than you realize. I would tell her that she can be a happier and healthier person if she stays true to herself, like I have finally been able to figure out. I wouldn\u2019t push her too far, I can\u2019t even tell myself who she is\u2014but I\u2019d try to start that conversation, and guide her in the right direction. These were just the things that I so badly needed to hear from someone when I was younger\u2014that we are all human, and can be loved and valued unconditionally.\n\n[Host]\nThat was actress Michelle Hendley voicing the words of Chelsea Manning, for Amnesty\u2019s \u201cIn Their Own Words.\u201d Chelsea is still in Fort Leavenworth military prison, Kansas. It will be 2045 before she\u2019s released, if she serves her full sentence. Amnesty is calling for Chelsea to be freed now. She was overcharged as a warning to others, while the abuses she reported have never been investigated.\n\nIn 2015, after she took the Army to court, Chelsea won the right to become the first military prisoner to access hormone treatment to transition in prison. But, she still can\u2019t grow her hair, and is forced to adhere to military grooming standards for males. So, that\u2019s her current battle.\n\nMeanwhile, the US Army is looking at reassessing how trans people in the forces are treated. In no small part, thanks to Chelsea. So does she looking forward to, after she served her sentence?\n\n[Chelsea Manning]\nI feel like I\u2019ve been stored away for all this time without a voice or the ability to show my love and support to the folks who need it. I feel like there\u2019s so much of a contribution to society that I could be making. I spend every day looking forward to the hope that one day I can give that a go.\n\n[Host]\nI\u2019m Anna Bacciarelli. You\u2019ve been listening to \u201cIn Their Own Words,\u201d a podcast series from Amnesty International.

Deja vu again?\n\nKATSUYA: Now Mt. Iwato of Araya...What is Tatsuya trying to do?\n\nNATE: It appears that Suou's purpose is to make you realize...or\nremember something, Ms. Amano. Do you have any ideas?  I am interested,\nsince I've gotten involved in this.\n\nELLEN: Perhaps Tatsuya wants you to remember something, Ms. Amano? It\nappears to be that way...\n\nULALA: Did you hear what that old woman said?  Looks like something\nhappened here.\n\nOLD WOMAN: W-What just happened...?

Are you saying that Amano's visions are all\nmemories of a different reality...?\n\nKATSUYA: Are you saying that Ms. Amano and Tatsuya Sudou came from the\nsame reality as you!?\n\nTATSUYA: That's not entirely true...Sudou was truly a person of \"This\nSide\"...He was told by \"him\" of the existence of the \"Other Side\" and\nwas only being used...\n\nULALA: So what do you mean!? It's not like Ma-ya came from that world\neither, right?  Why does Ma-ya only have the memory of this \"Other\nSide\"? None of us have it!\n\nTATSUYA: There are many reasons...I don't think you should know any\nmore...\n\nKATSUYA: Idiot...! As if we can back out after all this!\n\nTATSUYA: If you continue, something bad may happen!\n\n*MAYA: Tatsuya...I have a right to know.*\n\nTATSUYA: Fine...A picture is worth a thousand words...\n\n(Tatsuya goes on ahead.

Forever, the five of us all\ntogether...we all believed that...But Maya had to leave town for family\nreasons...We couldn't bear that, so we locked Maya in the shrine...And\nthen Sudou set it aflame...We thought Maya had died, so we were\nscared...And each of us suppressed the memory...Jun remembered that and\nbecame a Joker. Controlled by \"him\", he tried to end the world in\nexchange for the ideal evolution.\n\n\nREALITY\n\nULALA: His story...It's just like what we're going through, don't you\nthink...?\n\nKATSUYA: Who is that \"him\" that controlled Jun...?\n\nTATSUYA: His appearence was that of Jun's father, but inside was\ncompletely different... Crawling Chaos...Nyarlathotep...He is the being\nthat stands opposite to Philemon...The shadow that lurks deep within\nman's heart, toying with destiny...\n\nTATUSYA: He wants to bring the same chaos to This Side as the Other\nSide. The New World Order is just one of his pawns.\n\nBAOFU: Hey, what do you mean...causing the same thing to happen?\n\nTATSUYA:......You'll find out.\n\n(He goes on ahead. Talk to your members.)\n\nULALA: There's a boss behind the New World Order...?  And that guy's in\neach and everyone of us!?\n\nBAOFU: The ideal-collecting Masquerade, and the Kegare-collecting New\nWorld Order, huh...Serizawa's right, the situations are similar...\n\nKATSUYA: The being that stands opposite to Philemon...? The archetype of\nexistential destruction...? If such a thing does exist, it is well\nbeyond our comprehension...The shadow of mankind...\n\nNATE: Nyarlathotep...!? It wasn't merely Guido's Persona?\n\nELLEN: Nyarlathotep...Crawling Chaos...The Faceless God...He is not just\na Persona?\n\n\nFINAL SPRING OF MIRRORS\n\nFLASHBACK: NYARLATHOTEP'S LAIR\n\n(This shows Tatsuya, Maya, Lisa, Eikichi, and Jun at Nyarlathotep's\nlair, which looks identical to Philemon's Lair.  Philemon and\nNyarlothotep appear.)\n\nPHILEMON: Going soft after playing the father?  Crawling\nChaos...Nyarlathotep.  Now you should understand what I said.\n\nNAYRLATHOTEP: Ha...It may be true these people can give us good results\nfor our research...\n\nGINKO: What are you saying, Philemon!?\n\nPHILEMON: We are the orgin of people's hearts...The Collective\nUnconsciousness is just one side of that coin...We've watched the\naffairs of man from here...I direct the strong of will, and he, the\nCrawling Chaos, drags the weak to Hell.  It is all in order to determine\nif people's hearts, which are in conflict, can arise as something\ncomplete...You all have displayed that possiblity.  If there are more\nhumans like you, humans can one day become a perfect existence...\n\nTATSUYA: Everything...This is all part of your experiment!?\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: You should show more respect to me. This one can only\nobserve.  However...I am different.\n\n(A woman that looks like Maya Okamura from Seven Sisters High School\nappears and stabs Maya with a spear. Maya then falls to the ground.)\n\nMAYA: .......?\n\nTATSUYA: Maya!!\n\n(Tatsuya and co. rush over to Maya's side and Lisa uses her Persona to\nheal Maya and Okamura teleports to Nyarlathotep's side.)\n\nEIKICHI: Dammit! Ginko! Use your powers!\n\nGINKO: I'm trying!! But...but...The blood won't stop!!  Why...Why won't\nmy spell work!? Philemon!?\n\nPHILEMON: Nyarlathotep...You spread the legend of the Sacred Spear, for\nthis...?\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Blood poured endlessly from the body of God's son when\npierced with that spear. It's the legend..or, \"rumor\" that you humans\nhave continued to tell for some 2000 years.  Quuite effective, isn't\nit?\n\nMAYA:.....\n\nMAYA:.......\n\nTATSUYA: \"Hurry up and forget about me?\"...Don't be ridiculous...!!! How\ncould I forget...!!?\n\nMAYA:.....\n\nTATSUYA: Yeah...I'll grab it...You taught me...I'll grab hold of my\ndream..so..\n\n(Maya dies)\n\nTATSUYA: ......Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Ha ha...Should people be able to realize their dreams?\nForsaking one of the same name, lost in illusion..This is this woman's\ndream.  I will make the human's dream of destruction come true!!\n\n\nREALITY\n\nTATSUYA: Do you remember now...?\n\n(Maya falls to the ground)\n\nMAYA: ...........\n\nKATSUYA: What happened...after that...?\n\nTATSUYA: Maya, with the name of Maya Okamura, died...The prophecy\nfullfilled...The whole world destroyed...leaving only Sumaru behind...\n\n(Everyone is shocked.)\n\nTATSUYA: In the World of Collective Unconsciousness, where we fought\nhim, strong beliefs became reality...By resetting our meeting 10 years\nago, we created another reality in exchange for the truths and memories\nuntil then...\n\nBAOFU: So that's this reality...\n\nTATSUYA: Maya told us to forget about her...To accept everything and\nmove on...But we couldn't stand it...That's why we made this reality, to\ntrade for our memories and we escaped here...Hanging on to a faint\nhope..to remember....\n\nULALA: .........\n\nTATSUYA: A hope like that couldn't happen...My freinds that meshed in\nThis Side forgot about the Other Side, and each other...But...I...\n\nBAOFU: So that's why Amano and that Jun kid don't remember about the\nOther Side...\n\nNATE: No wonder we natives of \"This Side\" don't have a memory of the\n\"Other Side\"...\n\nELLEN: We don't have a memory of the \"Other Side\", because we are\nnatives of \"This Side\"...\n\nTATSUYA: But that could change...\"He\" said I was \"the Paradox\"...This\nreality exists on the concept of the resetting of us five...If we all\nregain our memories, the distortion between the two worlds will\ngrow...And this world will cease to exist...\n\n(Everyone is shocked.)\n\nTATSUYA: I don't want Maya to be involved anymore...I'm sure you\nunderstand now...Please stay out of this...\n\nBAOFU: What were we talking about Serizawa?\n\nULALA: I don't know. Shouldn't the adults be the ones fooling the kids?\n\nKATSUYA: No...It's about adults taking responsibility for children's\nactions...\n\nTATSUYA (shocked): ............(mad) You tricked me...\n\n*MAYA: Dummy...! Look at you!*\n\n(Maya slaps Tatsuya and everyone is surprised.)\n\nTATSUYA: I-I...\n\n(Maya slaps Tatsuya again.)\n\nTATSUYA: I'm sorry...I understand...please don't get mad...\n\n(NATE'S ROUTE)\n\nNATE: Ha...I guess my work is done here...You're surrounded by good\nadults boy...You had better appreciate what they do for you.\n\nKATSUYA: What are you going to do...?\n\nNATE: I'm going to walk a path I believe in. I'll do all I can to end\nchaos in the city.\n\nBAOFU: Heh...If we're both still alive, let's knock one back together...\n\n(Nate nods his head and the screen goes black. Nate has left the group\nand Tatsuya joins.)\n\n(ELLEN'S ROUTE)\n\nELLEN: I guess this is it for my part...Tatsuya...now, it's a fight for\nyou and all...Take really good care of Ms. Amano.\n\nULALA: What are you going to do, Ellen?\n\nELLEN: With Nate, I'll help the people in this city. I will keep my\npromise. For myself.\n\nULALA: Your smile looks better! You'll be just fine. Good luck!\n\n(Ellen nods her head and the screen goes black. Ellen has left the group\nand Tatsuya joins.)\n\nCITY MAP: RENGEDAI\n\nKATSUYA: We've wasted so much time...We'd better hurry and catch up with\nTatsuzou, before it's too late.\n\nBAOFU: Kandori and that woman said that bastard headed for\nTorifune...how can we find it?\n\nTATSUYA: They created Torifune with a rumor, so if you follow the rumor\nabout the underground, you should find it...\n\n\nGATTEN SUSHI\n\nTATSUYA: Maya. Do you remember this is Eikichi's house? Eikichi...he's\nnot here...\n\nULALA: You must be puzzled Ma-ya.  I mean, you're dead on the Other\nSide..Well...You might not have any feeling of reality though.\n\n\nSUMARU PRISON\n\nTTSUYA:: A live house...I haven't touched a guitar for awhile.\n\n(The key to add Tatsuya to the Flamenco Contact.)\n\nTATSUYA: This is...the first place we met the Joker.  Not the same Joker\nfrom \"This Side\". ..I'm talking about my...our friend.\n\n\nHIRASAKA SATOMI TADASHI\n\nULALA: Hmm, I wonder if Satomi Tadashi was popular on the \"Other Side\"\ntoo? Hey Ma-ya, let's ask.\n\nTATSUYA: Satomi Tadashi...? I'm not sure if it was popular, but I did go\nthere often.\n\n\nIZAKAYA SHIRASHI\n\nTATSUYA: ...Why?...This place is different from the \"Other Side\"... Too\ndifferent!\n\nBAOFU: So this shop differs on the \"Other Side\". He doesn't have to be\nthat shocked, does he?\n\nULALA: So can only Tatsuya know the difference between here and the\n\"Other Side\"? ...Ah, can you tell too, Ma-ya?\n\nKATSUYA: I'm sure it's not as if only this shop is different from the\n\"Other Side\".  Maybe he just hasn't noticed everything else.\n\n\nKASU HIGH ROOFTOP\n\nKATSUYA: On the \"Other Side\" I wasn't able to help...But not here.  As\nthe brother of Tatsuya, as protector of Justice, I will aid you!\n\nMALE STUDENT: Did you watch TV today?...Wang Long fortune telling is\nsaying the pole shift is caused by New World Order?...What should we do?\n\nYASUO: You don't know anything, do you?... First off, it's \"Did you\nwatch the news on TV today\", not \"Did you watch TV?\" ... The outside\nworld has nothing to do with us... Our wolrd consists of just \"school\".\nOur worth as humans is decided here...\n\n\nYUMEZAKI SATOMI TADASHI\n\nULALA: Tatsuya just told me about a good diet food.  He knows someone\nwho knows a lot about that stuff!\n\n\nMU CONTINENT\n\nKATSUYA: I bet you enjoyed gambling on the \"Other Side\" too..I don't\nhave to ask Tatsuya to tell.\n\n\nPEACE DINER\n\nULALA: But I wonder...What am I like on the \"Other Side\"?  Maybe I was a\ncelebrity?\n\nKATSUYA: Judging from that, it seems Tatsuya amd I are not on good terms\nover on the \"Other Side\"\neither...\n\nTATSUYA: I see...Even on This Side she talks like a ninja...I guess it\ncan't be helped.\n\n\nROSA CANDIDA\n\nTATSUYA: That cave was different on the \"Other Side\" as well...Of\ncourse...Because there is no Masquerade here...\n\n\nLUNAR PALACE\n\nKATSUYA: It seems that on the \"Other Side\", this room is the same...Just\nlook at Tatsuya.\n\nTATSUYA: ...Actually, I never planned to come back here\nagain......EVER...\n\n\nSUMARU GENIE\n\nBAOFU: I heard from Tatsuya on the \"Other Side\", that mystic was a\nrumormonger. As I thought, it's slightly different.\n\n\nKUZUNOHA\n\nTATSUYA: The rumor was manipulated on the Other Side. Although I was\nhelped in many other ways, I bet they wouldn't know me... But are prices\nhigher on \"This Side\"?  That Lucky Cat asked for only 100 on the \"Other\nSide\"...\n\nKATSUYA: Tatsuya and those guys must've been using this place on the\nOther Side like us...However, with a difference of 900 Yen.\n\nBAOFU: Uhhuuuuuh, even on the \"Other Side\"...This ol' man is suspicious\ntoo...Could he already be aware about Tatsuya?\n\nTAMMY: New World Order's goal is an ambitious one.  It was beyodg my\nimagination. Be careful, Ms. Amano.\n\n\nSUBWAY\n\n(Maya and the group enter inside the train and Maya takes the driver\nseat.)\n\nULALA: Maybe they used this subway to transport stuff?  There's food and\nall kinds of stuff.\n\nBAOFU: Hmph, who're they kidding...They set this thing up and tried to\nmake a rumor come true, they must be insane...\n\nKATSUYA: Um, Ms. Amano, are you sure you can drive? Perhaps I should,\ninstead?\n\n(Maya shakes her head no and she starts to drive.  While riding......)\n\nTATSUYA: .......\n\nBAOFU: .....\n\nULALA: Hey Tatsuya I found some drinks, want some?\n\n(Tatsuya shakes his head no and Ulala sits down.)\n\nULALA: Hey, Tatsuya...Something's been bugging me...Why are you the only\none who recalls the \"Other Side\"?\n\nTATSUYA: .....\n\nBAOFU: Don't have to say what you don't want to...Besides...What I want\nto know is what are WE like on the \"Other Side\"?  We were there, right?\n\nTATSUYA: My brother is pretty much the same...Ulala was scammed by a con\nartist...I only know you spread rumors on the net...\n\nBAOFU: So the \"Other Side\" is not that different...\n\nTATSUYA: ..........Is it hard...being an adult?\n\nBAOFU: Huh?\n\nTATSUYA: No...never mind...Forget about it...\n\nBAOFU: What about you?\n\nTATSUYA: .........\n\nBAOFU: It's the same...There's nothing good. The pain just keeps\ngrowing...\n\nULALA: ........\n\nKATSUYA / MAYA: ..........\n\nKATSUYA: Hmm...? Ms. Amano, it's a dead end...Please stop.\n\n(Maya stops the train.)\n\nBAOFU: Welcome to the \"Gates of Hell\"...Worry about everything\nlater...You're still young...You got lots of time. That is, if you stay\nalive...\n\n\nSUBWAY CONSTRUCTION SITE:\n\n(Talk to members)\n\nULALA: Adults, huh...? What are adults anyway?\n\nTATSUYA: I guess we have to walk from here...We can't just go back\neasily.  This is our last chance to turn back...\n\n(If you decide to leave)\n\nTATSUYA: Maya...are we going back...?\n\n*MAYA: No, no, it's nothing.*\n\n\nBAOFU'S LAIR (after being in the Subway)\n\nULALA: I was tricked by him on the \"Other Side\" after all. Huh...Just\nlike Ma-ya's flashback...\n\nBAOFU: It seems I was collecting rumors over there too.  Not very\ndifferent from here...At one time I was kinda curious about an alternate\nworld...But it's actually pretty boring.\n\n\nOUTSIDE AMENO TORIFUNE:\n\n(Maya and co. are underground and they see the Ameno Torifune in the\ndistance.)\n\n\nAMENO TORIFUNE CONTROL ROOM\n\n(The scene cuts to the Control Room.  Tatsuzou is standing on a\nplattform and his 4 NWO executives and General Sugawara are right behind\nhim.  Tenchu Soldiers and Scientists are watching him from below.)\n\nTATSUZOU: Tenchu soldiers! Finally , the prophecy of Torifune has come\ntrue! Gozen awaits! All we need to do now is release Joka to cleanse the\nkegare of the world by the hands of the 12 Dragons!!\n\n(The crowd cheers.)\n\nTATSUZOU: We ask! What has human history been up 'til now!!  Various\nreligions! Tribes! Desires! Values! Was the human history laden with\nthese, a history of \"sin\"!!? The masses blessed with material, lost\ntheir ideals. They don't examine themselves or even try to atone for\ntheir sins! We must provide a dream of reconstructing a new future and\ncleanse the rotting world!  This is the \"Punishment\"!!! And the chosen\nones will know!!! The future of salvation stands before us!\n\n(The crowd cheers again and the screen darkens and moves to Sugawara.)\n\nGENERAL SUGAWARA: You twisted bastard...\n\n(The screen lightens up again.)\n\nTATSUZOU: Sugawara...\n\nGENERAL SUGAWARA: Yessir...\n\nTATSUZOU: I leave the Torifune to you.  We will ascend to Utena with\nGozen.  Prepare the Petit Deva...\n\nGENERAL SUGAWARA:  Yessir...it shall be done.\n\nTATSUZOU: Do not worry about your frailty, my freind...Gozen is very\nhappy with your work. Your wish for immortality will be granted.\n\nGENERAL SUGAWARA: Ah...! My loyalty has finally been rewarded...\n\nTATSUZOU: Your body might change slightly though...\n\nGENERAL SUGAWARA: What was that?\n\n(Tatsuzou and his 4 NWO executives leave.)\n\n\nOUTSIDE THE TORIFUNE\n\nBAOFU: Hmmm...Impressive...\n\nTATSUYA: Well, considering it can fly with a city on top of it, it\nbetter be...\n\nULALA: This is rumored to be a ship of a god or aliens, right...? Don't\nyou think they would've set traps or something?\n\nTATSUYA: This ship, called \"Xibalba\" on the \"Other Side\", makes bad\nthoughts real...You shouldn't think of anything bad.\n\nKATSUYA: How do you know...?\n\nTATSUYA: People's fear...insecurity...hopes...It borrows the form of\nrumors, it is the incarnation of the unconscious world...\n\n(Tatsuya flicks his lighter.)\n\nTATSUYA: I think that's why Philemon said thoughts would become reality\nin the unconscious world...\n\nULALA: Then all we gotta do is think pleasant thoughts...Piece of\ncake...\n\nTATSUYA: No...This is his domain...Don't think anything...\n\n(Maya and co. enter and inside, the whole room is hot and the party is\ngoing crazy.)\n\nKATSUYA: It, It's no use...! The door won't budge!\n\nBAOFU: Yow! Hot!...What's going on!? Serizawa! You thought of something\nbad, didn't you!?\n\nULALA: Yow! Hot!...It, It's not me!!!\n\nTATSUYA: ...I'm sorry. It was something that happened\npreviously......So...I inadvertently...\n\nBAOFU / ULALA: Wh, Wha-----t!?\n\nKATSUYA: It's no use talking about what we thought!  So what happened on\nthe \"Other Side\", Tatsuya!?\n\nTATSUYA: ...I ran.\n\nBAOFU / KATSUYA / ULALA: Ahhhh!?\n\nTATSUYA: \"If you concertrate, even an oven is cool!\" ...Is what Maya\nsaid.\n\n(Maya does her positive gesture and she and Tatsuya go ahead.  Ulala\ntrips and then catches up to them.)\n\nKATSUYA: That's unreasonable...\n\nBAOFU: You gotta be kiddin' me!? Yow! Hot! This is not my idea of fun...\n\n(Baofu and Katsuya catch up with Maya and the others.)\n\nBAOFU / KATSUYA: Uoooooh?!? My sunglasses are melting off my face!!!\n\n(The party enters inside the Torifune.)\n\n\nAMENO TORIFUNE\n\nROOM OF INSULT\n\n(Dead Tenchu Soldiers are lying on the ground in a pool of blood.)\n\nKATSUYA: This is the Tenchu Army. It seems that they were caught in a\ntrap...\n\nULALA: Is this also the work of that \"Nyar-something\"!? ...Isn't it\nweird!?...Why does he kill his own men...!\n\nTATSUYA: It's proof that the New World Order isn't aware of the secret\nof the Torifune...\"He\" thinks of humans as mere pawns...They probaly\ndon't even know of \"his\" existence.\n\n(Talk to Members)\n\nTATSUYA: This ship...him...Neither one anything a human should mess\nwith...\n\nBAOFU: I don't care about the Crawling Chaos, but I'm not letting them\nget away...I'm gonna be the one to kill Tatsuzou...\n\n\nROOM OF DAMNATION\n\nULALA: Hey everyone, wait up a sec...Let's walk a little slower...\n\nBAOFU: Suck it up...If you can't keep up, we're leaving you...\n\nULALA: It can't be helped...I don't walk this much even at work. Isn't\nthere a place to recover?\n\nKATSUYA: It HAS been a while we've been underground. If there was a\nVelvet Room, we could rest there...\n\nTATSUYA: It's there...A Fountain, a Velvet Room...\n\nULALA: Really...!?\n\nKATSUYA: It's awfully suspicious...That Nyarlathotep guy decides wether\nor not to make our thoughts a reality, right? Why does he give things so\nconviently?\n\nTATSUYA: He's playing with us...\n\nBAOFU: I don't know what he's up to, but if I can use it, then I will...\n\n(Baofu and Ulala go in one door while Katsuya goes in one door alone.\nTatsuya begins to sit down and Maya sits next to him.)\n\nMAYA: .........\n\nTATSUYA: .........\n\nMAYA: .........\n\n(Tatsuya gets up.)\n\nTATSUYA: .........\n\n*MAYA: Th, Thank you for saving me...!*\n\nTATSUYA: This is...the burden of sin...\n\nTATSUYA: You...don't have to worry about me...\n\n(Metal forms of Jun, Eikichi, and Lisa come out from the doors.)\n\nTATSUYA: Wh...at...!?\n\nMETAL LISA: Why...Why is my only Chinyan (darling) next to Maya!?\n\nMETAL EIKICHI: That's cruel...Tatsu...You don't care about us?\n\n(Maya and Tatsuya draw thier weapons.)\n\nTATSUYA: Get back...!!! These are...illusions that my heart called!\n\n(Tatsuya strikes Jun, but Jun is not affected.)\n\nTATSUYA: Damn!\n\nMETAL JUN: Tatsuya...Was the promise to protect Maya a lie...?\n\nTATSUYA: .........\n\nMETAL JUN: It's okay...You don't have to suffer by yourself anymore...\n\n(The Metal kids disappear along with Tatsuya and Maya panics. Then the\nothers come out from the doors.)\n\nULALA: Huh...? Where's Tatsuya?\n\n(Maya explains what happened.)\n\nKATSUYA: What did you say...!?\n\nBAOFU: Ch...! We fell for it...Come on! We gotta find him!\n\n(Talk to party members)\n\nULALA: Oh, come on Ma-ya! What were you doing!!!...Wait...I'm the one\nmostly at fault...\n\nBAOFU: They pulled a dirty trick on us..I like his style...Too bad it\nwon't do him any good...\n\nKATSUYA: Damn...Tatsuya's letting his pride get in the way. He's trying\nto carry the weight of the world\non his shoulders...!\n\n\nTORIFUNE B6\n\nKATSUYA: Tatsuya's still alive...We must hurry...\n\n\nROOM OF GUILT\n\n(The place is Araya Shrine. Tatsuya is tied onto an altar with the Metal\nkids standing over him.)\n\nMETAL EIKICHI: \"We went through a lot, but I'm glad we met again...\"\n\nMETAL LISA: \"Chinyan (darling)...Don't forget about me...\"\n\nMETAL JUN: \"I won't forget...the sin I commited, you or anyone...\"\nTatsuya...Have you forgotten?\n\nTATSUYA: How can I...forget...\n\nMETAL LISA: But...you broke an important promise, didn't you...?\n\nMETAL EIKICHI: That's why...you're suffering, right...?\n\nTATSUYA: I'm sorry...\n\nMETAL JUN: Tatsuya...You can stop suffering...Let us ease you\nsuffering...?\n\n(Jun tries to stab Tatsuya, but Tatsuya stops it with his hand.)\n\nTATSUYA: Jun...I'll accept my punishment...But...not now...\n\n(Maya and co. jump in and the Boss Battle Theme from Persona 2: Innocent\nSin plays.)\n\nKATSUYA: Tatsuya!!\n\n(Katsuya fires shots but doesn't affect the kids.)\n\nBAOFU: Ch...Physical attacks don't even scratch 'em!\n\nTATSUYA: .........!?\n\n(Enter Battle)\n\nMETAL JUN: It's okay...You can stop suffering...\n\nTATSUYA: I'll accept my punishment...But...not now...!\n\n(After Battle)\n\n(The room is back to normal and Katsuya is tending to Tatsuya's wounds.)\n\nKATSUYA: I thought I taught you to hold a knife by its handle...\n\nTATSUYA: I'm sorry...\n\nKATSUYA: Don't say anything. My brother doesn't lower his head for\nlittle things like this...\n\nTATSUYA: No...The me of \"This Side\", also feels the same way...\n\nKATSUYA: I see...\n\nULALA: How can you two be brothers?\n\n(Talk to Members)\n\nTATSUYA: I'm sorry Maya...I troubled you...\n\n\nROOM OF TRANSPORT\n\nKATSUYA: Tatsuya...What is this?\n\nTATSUYA: I think it's some sort of teleportation device...it was another\nsymbol in the \"Other Side\"...\n\nULALA: It's called...\"Petite Deva\". It's written here.\n\nBAOFU: The symbol of Kandori...If we use this, we might be able to get\nback to the city.\n\n\nCONTROL ROOM\n\n(Maya and co. enter and there are dead soldiers all covered in blood,\nKatsuya checks one soldier's body.)\n\nKATSUYA: He has a pulse...!!!\n\nSOLDIER OF THE TENCHU ARMY: S...Save me...I don't...wanna die...\n\nKATSUYA: ...It's alright...You're not gonna die...What happened...?\n\nSOLDIER OF THE TENCHU ARMY:\nGeneral...became...monster......Everyone...killed...\nTell...daughter...grab...your dream...\n\nMAYA / KATSUYA : .........\n\nCREEPY VOICE: I......TAAAAIeeee...\n\nULALA: W, What...!?\n\nTATSUYA: .........!?\n\n(General Sugawara, who is now become a monster appears.)\n\nWAS SUGAWARA: Aaaarrrgh!!! It hurts!!!\n\n(A sound is heard and the party turns around to look at the screen.  An\nFMV is shown of Sumaru Castle rising out near Seven Sisters High School.\nThe walls of the Torifune surround Sumaru City and it rises up\ninto the air.)\n\nMAYA: .........!!!\n\nULALA: You're kidding me...?\n\nKATSUIYA: What, have they done!?\n\nBAOFU: Ch...!!!\n\n(enter battle)\n\nTATSUYA: Ugh...But, it's not too late...!!\n\nTATSUYA: Sudou is probaly in that castle...! He still has to do the\nDragon Ritual...!!! We haven't lost yet...!!!\n\n(after battle)\n\n(Maya, Baofu, and Katsuya are firing shots at Sugawara and then Tatsuya\npushes him off the plattform using his sword.)\n\nWAS SUGAWARA: Aaaarrrgh!!\n\nKATSUYA: I don't care if you're immortal or not...You lose...\n\n(a moment later)\n\nBAOFU: It's no good, it's not budging an inch...We couldn't land this\nship even if we wanted to...\n\nULALA: What are we gonna do!?...The city's flying...At this rate, the\ndragons will appear, and the earth's axis will rotate!\n\nKATSUYA: As long as we're alive, we can stop him...Tatsuya is right. We\nhaven't lost yet...We're gonna bring this ship down the way we're gonna\nbring down Sudou! Even if he has backup!\n\nBAOFU: That's fine, but looking at the teleport device he used, we can't\nstand around...A bit late, but we're going back up!!\n\n\nARAYA SHRINE\n\nBAOFU: Hmmm...It looks like we caught the last ride out of there...\n\n(Sumaru City is now in the air.  The City Map music is different (it's a\nremix of the previous City Map Music.) and Sumaru Castle is now located\nwhere Honmaru Park used to be. You can also get rumors from\n2X Slash and Johnny Rogers and bring Clair de Lune to Aoba and Padparcha\nin Konan.)\n\nRENGEDAI SATOMI TADASHI:\n\nTATSUYA: Ch...The Ameno Torifune...Even the shape is the same as the\nXibalba...\n\nHIRASAKA SATOMI TADASHI:\n\nSALAM LADEEN: Is it okay for a city to fly? Did the Lord allow it?\nNo...I must go. But the land is more\ndangerous...\n\n\nTOMI CHIROPRACTOR:\n\nTATSUYA: Sumaru Castle....it was just a park on the Other Side...As I\nfigured, it's different from before.\n\n\nIZAKAYA SHIRASHI:\n\nSHIRASHI LADY: Something like this happened before. Xibalba...?Ohh...I'm\ngetting a funny feeling.\nSUMARU PRISON:\n\nKEN: Wonder what happened to Michel!? When it is like this, we got to be\nworried! But I bet Ms. Miyabi is even more worried.\n\nMIYABI: Eikichi is very lucky, isn't he? He has so many great\ncompanions. I will believe in Eikichi's return and wait here.\nKASU HIGH ROOFTOP:\n\nMALE STUDENT: Yasuo!!!...Look at Narumi! It's all messed up!?\n\nYASUO: Looking from up here, everything looks so small...(sigh)...If I\njust realized sooner, my life might've been different....What...do I\nwant to do?\n\nBIKINI LINE:\n\nTATSUYA: It is lucky that at least the temple didn't come out. Even the\nslightest difference from the Other Side is good.\n\nAKI DUDE: What happened to me?...A while ago, I had a dream this city\nwas flying in the air...Could it have been a prophecy?\n\nSEEDY CD:\n\nSTORE OWNER: It's funny, but I'm not surprised that this city's flying.\nWas there something like this before? There wasn't, right?\n\nIXQUIC: Oh, misses! Big problem, big problem!!! There's a faster demon\nnow! Now it's 200 km/h Fogey!! The kids in the neighborhood said they\nsaw it at The Seedy CD!!! I must fulfill my duty as the transmigrated\nwarrior maiden! Demons that threaten human's lives, I shall whoop your\nasses!\n\n(Spread the rumor, fight the 200 km/h Fogey and recieve the Top Speed\nTitle. Show it to Ixquic.)\n\nIXQUIC: What the...!? The thing that you have...Isn't it Top Speed\nTitle!? Wow...Misses, you already beat up the 200 km/h Fogey? Are you a\ntransmigrated warrior, too? Please! Can you trade that Top-Speed Title\nwith my treasure? I REALLY need that! PLEASE!!!\n\n*MAYA: (Trade)*\n\nIXQUIC: Really!? Yaaaaaaaay!!! Okay then, here's your Legenbright.\nThanks, Misses!!!\n\nIXQUIC: Now that I think about it, I feel I've met you before. I wonder\nif this is also memories from my previous life...\n\nJOHNNY ROGERS\n\nULALA: I see...Everyone thinks the events that happened on the \"Other\nSide\" are dreams or something.\n\nTATSUYA: There are more people who saw the same spectacle. It's proof\nthat the world is starting to\ndisappear...At this rate...\n\nRUMORMONGER BARKKEPER: So this a prophetic dream...I dreamt awhile back\nthat the city was floating. The ship below was called the \"Xibalba\"...\n\nSUMARU GENIE\n\nTATSUYA: Ulala asked me what I was called on the \"Other Side\"...All I\ndid was answer...\n\nULALA:Awwwwwwwwwe...Tatsuya was called \"Tatsu\" over on the \"Other Side\".\n\nKATSUYA: \"Tatsu\", huh...It's not a bad nicknam. Hmm? Then what about me?\n\n\nHIIRAGI THERAPY:\n\nULALA: Ma-ya! Mary went out on her own! Is she okay?\n\nREIKO: Mary went outside. She said she couldn't leave the city as it\nis...I hope she's alright...\n\nPADPARCHA:\n\nTATSUYA:\"Everyone has the right to grasp a dream\". That is what you said\non the Other Side, but do I really have the right to grasp one?...\n\n\nSUMARU TV:\n\nCORPSE OF A TENCHU SOLDIER: (Looks like he was a member of the Civil\nDefense Force. He's already stopped breathing.)\n\nBRAD: Da ha ha ha...What happened? You look so surprised. Are you\nsurprised by my activity? Da ha ha ha! ...Well, that's the deal, so you\nguys go on to the Sumaru Castle without any worry. I'll show the people\nof the city just how way cool I am.\n\nMAMI: It seems Lisa hasn't come home yet either. Where could she have\ngone at a time like this...? Even this place would have been in danger\nif it weren't for Mr. Brad Uesugi...Her father must be worried as well.\n\nMIHO: Did you know? Brad Uesugi is very powerful! He may be a good match\nfor Lisa's father. But based on impact, Lisa's dad wins! He's REALLY\nscary when he's mad. He does not say a word!

There was once a Sumaru Castle, and now there is\na Sumaru Castle at the same location...That's all.\n\nTATSUYA: It's just like Baofu said...The Sumaru Castle wasn't on the\n\"Other Side\"...But it is on \"This Side\"...That's all.\n\n\nKISMET EDITORIAL ROOM:\n\nFUJII: Eh, Yukki? Yukki went out to protect everybody...To stop the\nTenchu Army. I'm going to record\nthis real event in its entirety on film. That's the onlt thing I can\ndo....That is my cuase.\n\n\nMIZUNO'S OFFICE:\n\nEDITOR-IN-CHIEF MIZUNO: Amano!...Get that man out of here! I let him in\nbecuase the Editor-in-Chief of Moo magazine insisted. I found out it was\nto get rid of him! There's no time for that!!\n\nMR. KASHIHARA: Hello there...I checked the legend about this incident,\nand I found out something incredible! I thought I thought I had to let\nthe Editor-in-Chief of Moo magazine know about this...It's a little\nlong, but would you listen?\n\n*MAYA: This isn't Moo.*\n\nMR. KASHIHARA: Oh really?...I'm terribly sorry.\n\n(A moment later)\n\nEDITOR-IN-CHIEF MIZUNO: Who was that man...?\n\n\nPARABELLUM:\n\nMATSUOKA: With the surfacing of Ameno Torifune, and the show of the\nTenchu Army, this city's in more chaos than ever...But, don't\nworry...Leave the safety of the people to us.  Master Nate is battling\nthe Tenchu Army with his comrades. Master Amano, you have a mission to\naccomplish...Please hurry to Sumaru Castle.\n\nRUMOR-LOVIN' BARTENDER: Oh welcome! I'm so glad, you are unharmed...Huh,\nme? There was a rumor amongour regulars that Narumi was in danger. You\nwouldn't want anything to happen for real, right?\nThen right when I moved just to be safe....Now this world is really\ngoing to end? Ah, but at least we're still safe.\n\nRUMOR-LOVIN' BARTENDER: Do you know the purging of the Tenchu Army? They\nkill those who have Kegare in them...Please watch out!\n\nSUMARU CASTLE\n\nSTATUE OF JOKA: I am Joka...The one who opens the door to Utena...it is\nsuggested to solemly offer\nancient prayers...\n\nSTATUE OF FUKUGI: I am Fukugi...Prayers of Kotodama, the spirited\nwords...You should gather the 7\nKotodama and offer ancient prayers....\n\n(talk to party members)\n\nULALA: This is the \"Big Dipper\", right? There's one more in between the\nstatues..What's that one?\n\nBAOFU: There's no door connecting to the back...So those lights lead to\nsomewhere....\n\nKATSUYA: Prayers? Seven Kotodama...? Are they saying if we don't figure\nthis out, we won't be able to open Utena's door?\n\nTATSUYA: A black hole...That means trouble...\n\n\nKEGARE CHAMBER\n\n(Talk to party members)\n\nBAOFU: We can't just destroy that thing without giving it some thought\nfirst...They saved up some pretty nasty things.\n\nULALA: How much is in there...? The back is all hazy, so I can't see...\n\nKATSUYA: The Kegare they got from the people...They're transporting\nit...somewhere...\n\nTATSUYA: I cannot run away from my sin....so easily...I have to atone\nfor my sin by myself...\n\nCHAMBER OF HENBAI\n\nPLAINSPHERE LITHOGRAPH: One who knoweth the intention of the 7 Kotodama.\nThou shalt offer the great paryer.\n\n(PASSWORD IS PERSEUS)\n\nPLAINSPHERE LITHOGRAPH: One who realizes the intention of the Seven\nSpirits offer the Henbai of Perseus, and walk the path to the stage. If\nthou completest this, the Hokutoku Gohou shall be unbound, and\nthe path to the Stage shall open.\n\nKATSUYA: I did some research prior to coming here. Perseus is a\nconstellation named after the man who slew Medusa in Greek mythology.\nMany people of ancient times believed in the stars, and it's no surprise\nthat Perseus was picked. He was a heroic figure. It IS a bit odd for\nthem to use a Western name, but people today have strange ideas of\nmagic. Another effect of rumors, I guess.\n\nULALA: Wow, you're such a hardworking guy. So what's a \"henbai\"?\n\nKATSUYA: Henbai is a type of \"magical stepping\" that originated in\nChina. With this, you crush evil stars and invite good luck. Hokutoku is\na magic where  you draw Ursa Major on the earth to sanctify and protect\nthat area...Most likely, it means to walk in a certain pattern, or\nsomething like that...\n\n\nCHAMBER OF UTENA\n\n(The Four NWO executives are lying dead becuase Tatsuzou Sudou killed\nthem with a sword, the party comes inside and confronts him.)\n\nKATSUYA: Sudou...!? You bastard...!!!\n\nBAOFU: You've finally gone mad...Tatsuzou!!!\n\nTATSUZOU: Mad you say...? This world is what's gone mad!  Tell me what\nis stirring this country!!\n\nTATSUZOU: Fronts, fatigue, and contradictions...People think only of\nthemselves!! And so, punishment will be yours again!! This world is\ndecayed..The law, the system, and all humans who live off of it!!!\n\nKATSUYA: Damn you, Tatsuzou! What right do you have to judge us!?\n\nBAOFU: That's bullshit...Deceiving people with stupid curses...Your\ndeception ends here, old man!\n\nTATSUZOU: Fools...You don't understand human nature.  Curses and\nfortunes were things you wanted! Look down there! People are still\ncurious about fortunes, jinxes, and wish for good luck...You cannot stop\na heart that involunterily pumps its blood for curses!... Or the pulsing\npower of life it brings!\n\nTATSUZOU: Arise, Gozen! I have delivered you the Kegare of my sinful\ncompratriots! Let people's words become a reality!!!\n\n(An FMV plays of the dragons being summoned from around the world, and\nthey all gather at Sumaru Castle.)\n\nULALA / MAYA: Oh my God!\n\nTATSUZOU: Hahaha!! Hya--hahaha!! Behold!! The Earth Dragon will destroy\nEarth along with Joka!! The axis will shift and people shall die!! I\nhave transformed history!! What is life if you can't even bear this!?\n\n(Tatsuzou starts to shake.)\n\nTATSUZOU: Gwo..!?

A.K.A Kiyotada Sumaru.)\n\n(enter battle)\n\nTATSUYA: I see...You won't come out until I defeat this guy...\n\nGOZEN: Who are you, to awaken me from my slumber!?\n\n(After Battle)\n\n(Gozen lies on the floor.)\n\nBAOFU: Did we do it...!?\n\n(Gozen explodes into pink energy.)\n\nKATSUYA: That can't be...What the hell is that...!?\n\n(An FMV plays of Sumaru City in chaos. The dragons disappear, the\nTorifune walls twist and crumble, and Sumaru City is being sucked into\nan unknown dimension.

It suits me, don't you agree?\n\nTATSUYA: Shut up...!!!\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Humans are strange...I came here because you wanted to\nmeet me...Now you want me to go? You're contradicting yourself...\n\nNYARLATHOTEP (as Ulala): By the way...do you know the \"three poisons of\nlife\"?...What I'm referring to is \"Anger\", \"Ignorance\", and \"Vengeance\".\n\nNYARLATHOTEP (as Baofu): There are countless others, but these are my\nprimary sources of power.\n\nNYARLATHOTEP (as Katsuya): Oh, come now...You disappoint me...It's\nreally simple...Even your pathetic brain can comprehend that...\n\nKATSUYA: Are you trying to say...that you are the \"shadow\" of us\nhumans!?\n\nNYARLATHOTEP (as Maya): So, you do understand...I am a reflection of\nyour true selves...Let's play one last game...\n\n(Eikichi, Jun, and Lisa appear, but they are chained up in the air and\nNyarlathotep reverts back to his Tatsuya form.)\n\nTATSUYA: Jun...Eikichi...Lisa!!!\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: You remember what I told you, right? If they remember the\nOther Side, then this world will cease to exist.  You of all people\nshould understand...Right, Tatsuya?

Well, I\nsaved the best for last...We must show your secret to your freinds.\nRight, \"Paradox Boy\"?...\n\n\nFLASHBACK: NYARLATHOTEP'S LAIR\n\n(This shows the continuing scene from the final flashback at Mt. Iwato\nafter Maya dies.)\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Huhahahahaha!!! You have learned something. The reality of\nthe world..There are things that you have no control over! I am the\nshadow of all humans. As long as humans have dark hearts, I will live.\nFace the last trial of the Crawling Chaos!!!\n\n(Nyarlathotep changes into a monster-like creature and disappears along\nwith Maya Okamura.)\n\nPHILEMON: There is a way to change this reality. You must forget about\nthat one summer day...Nyarlathotep began weaving the threads of fate\nthat day...If we erase that instance, this tragedy would never have\noccured. A new time woven and a world reborn...\n\nEIKICHI: You can...do that...?\n\nPHILEMON: Realize this...A human's heart possess the power to change the\nflow of reality. Even without the Xilbalba or the Crystal Skull, your\nstrong will and action have the energy to change reality. Even the\npower that created the cosmos you live in is the same as yours..In this\ncollective unconsciousness, it is\npossible.\n\nJUN: Do you mean start over from the beginning?  In return for\nour...memories...?\n\nGINKO: You mean...forget everyone...!? I...I don't want to!!  Isn't\nthere another way!?\n\nPHILEMON: Not in this world, where he has power. The dark hearts of\npeople unconsciously doing world destruction is his source of power...In\norder to suppress him, people must change...You will create the new\nworld...\n\nJUN: I...won't forget...How can I forget...\n\nEIKICHI: Hell yeah...I ain't gonna forget...!! If everything was set up\nby him, then let's do it...Let's teach him that things won't go his way\nanymore...\n\nGINKO: We...WILL...meet again, right...?\n\nPHILEMON: Then see yourself as who you should be. Your powers should\nmold a new reality.\n\n(Jun disappears, then Eikichi, and then the dead Maya. Lisa walks up to\nTatsuya to give him a kiss.)\n\nGINKO: A kiss...So that I won't forget about my Tatsuya...\n\n(Lisa disappears.)\n\nPHILEMON: Well then...We will part for a short time. Are there any final\nwords you want to say?\n\n*TATSUYA: (Hit Him)*\n\n(Tatsuya punches Philemon and Philemon's mask comes off.  His face is\nthe same as Tatsuya's.)\n\nPHILEMON: I am the one who exists in the boundary between the\nconsciousness and the unconsciousness...I am you and you are I...I will\nalways be watching from within you...Farewell...\n\n(Tatsuya disappears.)\n\n(An FMV plays of the kids saying goodbye to each other)\n\nEIKICHI: We went through a lot, but I'm glad we met again. Don't forget\nwhat you promised dude.\n\nLISA: Tatsuya...Don't forget me...I do love you.\n\nJUN: You won't forget, or say goodbye. Just thank you.\n\nTATSUYA: I don't want to forget what happened! How can I forget?   Guys,\ndon't go...Don't leave me alone...Please no, please no.  No!....(echoes)\n\n(Tatsuya disappears. FMV ends there.)\n\n\nREALITY\n\nKATSUYA / MAYA / BAOFU / ULALA: .........!!!\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: (chuckles) How's that, Tatsuya Suou!? Do you like your\npunishment?  You couldn't ask them to fight with you. That's because the\nsole reason the world is at the brink of destruction\nis...YOU!!!\n\nTATSUYA: .........\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: You broke your promise with your freinds. The condition to\nstay in this world was to give up your memories from the old world!!!\nBut you rejected it, ...At that moment, the boundary\nseperating the 2 worlds vacillated...That was you!!! That's why you\nfailed to synchronize with the you of this world...\n\nMAYA: .........\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Push all the pain upon your freinds, and still retain your\nmemory...That's an unforgivable sin...A sin must have punishment.\nThat's why I gave you the chance to meet her again. I coaxed fate for\nyou all to meet again.\n\nTATSUYA: Ch...\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: What's wrong?...Are you going to hide in your shell again?\nThat face of yours when you met that woman and regained your\nmemories...You should have seen it...\n\nMAYA: .........\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Am I detestable? But that is what you humans desired...You\ncraved destruction from the depths of your hearts...That is me! The\nshadow does not forgive anyone who goes against fate.\n\nBAOFU: Ahhh, shut up...You can take this fate of yours and stick it up\nyour ass!  Listen up, Tatsuya...Fate is...\n\nKATSUYA: No different than a prediction too late. If something happens,\nall you have to say is this...\n\nULALA: \"It was all fate!\"\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Muhahahaha...!!! Pathetic humans! I'll show you what\nhappened to those who said the same thing to me in the past!!!\n\n(Nyarlathotep transforms into his Moon Howler form.)\n\n(Enter Battle)\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Understand that there is no point in living! Cry, that\nthere is no answer! Where there is darkness, there are shadows! I,\nmyself, am all of you humans!!\n\nTATSUYA: I won't turn my back again...On the sin I committed..Nor on\nmyself!!\n\nTATSUYA / NYARLATHOTEP: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!\n\n(After you beat his Moon Howler form, he'll change into his true form,\nwhich is a \"mass of gods with 1000 names and faces at the center of\nspace\" as his description says.)\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Fuhahahahaha! This is! Splendid! You are the first to see\nthis form! Die with my highest praise!\n\n(After Battle)\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: It...can't be...!? It's not possible...!!! This\ncontradiction...I won't accept i--t!!!\n\n(Philemon appears in the air carrying Jun in his arms.)\n\nPHILEMON: Crawling Chaos, accept your defeat...\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Philemon!!!\n\nPHILEMON: They represent the potential of mankind. You, the dark side of\nthe collective unconsciousness, are linked to all humans. THAT is\nwhy...They...moved the hearts of the people...\n\nKATSUYA: All potential is born from chaos...I see...That's right...\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Hmph...\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Muhahaha...!!! What irony!!! THIS is my FATE...!?\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: But...remember this...! The masses of idiocy that squim in\nthe center of the cosmos are yourselves...!!! As long as I you\nexist...so too shall I...!!!\n\nBAOFU: You're too damn stubborn...There's no such thing as a human\nwithout shadows...We'll make you remember that your place is here...Just\ngo to Hell and be done with it...\n\n(Maya shoots at Nyarlathotep and Tatsuya strikes Nyarlathotep.\nNyarlathotep screams and disappears.)\n\nULALA: It's over...\n\nTATSUYA: No...There's still...one more thing...\n\nTATSUYA: The fact remains that I'm the Paradox...If I stay here...Then\n\"This Side\" will be engulfed by the \"Other Side\"...\n\nBAOFU / KATSUYA: .........\n\nULALA / MAYA: Tatsuya...You're not...\n\nTATSUYA: I'm going home...\n\n*MAYA: Tatsuya...Thank you for everything...*\n\nTATSUYA: I made a promise to Jun...He kept his word...Now it's my\nturn...The only thing left on the Other Side is our city.  We'll rebuild\na great world...\n\nKATSUYA: Tatsuya...You...\n\n(Energy surrounds Tatsuya.)\n\nBAOFU: Tatsuya...There's one thing I forgot to tell you...There are good\nthings even when you become an adult...Just a few...\n\nTATSUYA: Yeah...I know...\n\n(Tatsuya splits into two.)\n\nKATSUYA: Tatsuya...!\n\nULALA: Tatsuya...!\n\nMAYA: .........\n\nTATSUYA FROM THE OTHER SIDE: We are connected by this ocean. We\ncan...meet again...\n\n(Tatsuya from the Other Side disappears and Tatsuya from This Side falls\non the floor.)\n\n\nThe spectre has returned to the deep corners of the subconscious, so too\nhas her love, retreated to a world beyond her reach. The city is showing\nsigns of recovery...but many will never know the truth of what happened.\nNonetheless, what Tatsuya left behind will live on in the hearts of the\npeople.

Nevertheless, our knowledge of the earliest stages of human civilization was quite limited for many centuries. That is, until the great archaeological discoveries of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which unearthed for us the great civilizations of the Ancient Near East, of which I have drawn a remarkably life-like map here on the board: [laughter] Mediterranean, I always start with the Mediterranean Ocean, the Nile River, the Tigris and the Euphrates. So: the great civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia and the area we refer to as the Fertile Crescent, of which a little part here about the size of Rhode Island is Canaan. And archaeologists in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were stunned to find the ruins and the records of remarkable peoples and cultures \u2014 massive, complex empires in some cases but some of which had completely disappeared from human memory. Their newly uncovered languages had been long forgotten; their rich literary and legal texts were now indecipherable. That soon changed. But because of those discoveries, we are now in a position to appreciate the monumental achievements of these early civilizations, these earliest civilizations.\n\nAnd so many scholars, and many people, have remarked that it's not a small irony that the Ancient Near Eastern people with one of the, or perhaps the most lasting legacy, was not a people that built and inhabited one of the great centers of Ancient Near Eastern civilization. It can be argued that the Ancient Near Eastern people with the most lasting legacy is a people that had an idea. It was a new idea that broke with the ideas of its neighbors, and those people were the Israelites. And scholars have come to the realization that despite the Bible's pretensions to the contrary, the Israelites were a small, and I've actually overrepresented it here, I'm sure it should be much smaller, a small and relatively insignificant group for much of their history. They did manage to establish a kingdom in the land that was known in antiquity as Canaan around the year 1000. They probably succeeded in subduing some of their neighbors, collecting tribute \u2014 there's some controversy about that \u2014 but in about 922 [BCE] this kingdom divided into two smaller and lesser kingdoms that fell in importance. The northern kingdom, which consisted of ten of the twelve Israelite tribes, and known confusingly as Israel, was destroyed in 722 [BCE] by the Assyrians. The southern kingdom, which consisted of two of the twelve tribes and known as Judah, managed to survive until the year 586 [BCE] when the Babylonians came in and conquered and sent the people into exile. The capital, Jerusalem, fell.\n\nConquest and exile were events that normally would spell the end of a particular ethnic national group, particularly in antiquity. Conquered peoples would trade their defeated god for the victorious god of their conquerors and eventually there would be a cultural and religious assimilation, intermarriage. That people would disappear as a distinctive entity, and in effect, that is what happened to the ten tribes of the northern kingdom to a large degree. They were lost to history. This did not happen to those members of the nation of Israel who lived in the southern kingdom, Judah. Despite the demise of their national political base in 586 [BCE], the Israelites alone, really, among the many peoples who have figured in Ancient Near Eastern history \u2014 the Sumerians, the Akkadians, the Babylonians, the Hittites, the Phoenicians, the Hurrians, the Canaanites \u2014 they emerged after the death of their state, producing a community and a culture that can be traced through various twists and turns and vicissitudes of history right down into the modern period. That's a pretty unique claim. And they carried with them the idea and the traditions that laid the foundation for the major religions of the western world: Judaism, Christianity and Islam.\n\nSo what is this radical new idea that shaped a culture and enabled its survival into later antiquity and really right into the present day in some form? Well, the conception of the universe that was widespread among ancient peoples is one that you're probably familiar with. People regarded the various natural forces as imbued with divine power, as in some sense divinities themselves. The earth was a divinity, the sky was a divinity, the water was a divinity, had divine power. In other words, the gods were identical with or imminent in the forces of nature. There were many gods. No one single god was therefore all powerful. There is very, very good evidence to suggest that ancient Israelites by and large shared this world view. They participated at the very earliest stages in the wider religious and cultic culture of the Ancient Near East. However, over the course of time, some ancient Israelites, not all at once and not unanimously, broke with this view and articulated a different view, that there was one divine power, one god. But much more important than number was the fact that this god was outside of and above nature. This god was not identified with nature. He transcended nature, and he wasn't known through nature or natural phenomena. He was known through history, events and a particular relationship with humankind. And that idea, which seems simple at first and not so very revolutionary \u2014 we will see, that's an idea that affected every aspect of Israelite culture and in ways that will become clear as we move through the course and learn more about biblical religion and biblical views of history, it was an idea that ensured the survival of the ancient Israelites as an entity, as an ethnic religious entity. In various complicated ways, the view of an utterly transcendent god with absolute control over history made it possible for some Israelites to interpret even the most tragic and catastrophic events, such as the destruction of their capital and the exile of their remaining peoples, not as a defeat of Israel's god or even God's rejection of them, but as necessary, a necessary part of God's larger purpose or plan for Israel.\n\nThese Israelites left for us the record of their religious and cultural revolution in the writings that are known as the Hebrew Bible collectively, and this course is an introduction to the Hebrew Bible as an expression of the religious life and thought of ancient Israel and as a foundational document of western civilization. The course has several goals. First and foremost, we want to familiarize you with the contents of the Hebrew Bible. We're not going to read every bit of it word for word. We will read certain chunks of it quite carefully and from others we will choose selections, but you will get a very good sense and a good sampling of the contents of the Bible. A second goal is to introduce you to a number of approaches to the study of the Bible, different methodological approaches that have been advanced by modern scholars but some of which are in fact quite old. At times, we will play the historian, at times we will be literary critics. \"How does this work as literature?\" At times we will be religious and cultural critics. \"What is it the Israelites were saying in their day and in their time and against whom and for what?\" A third goal of the course is to provide some insight into the history of interpretation. This is a really fun part of the course. The Bible's radically new conception of the divine, its revolutionary depiction of the human being as a moral agent, its riveting saga of the nation of Israel, their story, has drawn generations of readers to ponder its meaning and message. And as a result, the Bible has become the base of an enormous edifice of interpretation and commentary and debate, both in traditional settings but also in academic, university, secular settings. And from time to time, particularly in section discussion, you will have occasion to consider the ways in which certain biblical passages have been interpreted \u2014 sometimes in very contradictory ways \u2014 over the centuries. That can be a really fun and exciting part of the course.\n\nA fourth goal of the course is to familiarize you with the culture of ancient Israel as represented in the Bible against the backdrop of its Ancient Near Eastern setting, its historical and cultural setting, because the archaeological discoveries that were referred to [above] in the Ancient Near East, reveal to us the spiritual and cultural heritage of all of the inhabitants of the region, including the Israelites. And one of the major consequences of these finds is the light that they have shed on the background and the origin of the materials in the Bible. So we now see that the traditions in the Bible did not come out of a vacuum. The early chapters of Genesis, Genesis 1 through 11 \u2014 they're known as the \"Primeval History,\" which is a very unfortunate name, because these chapters really are not best read or understood as history in the conventional sense \u2014 but these 11 chapters owe a great deal to Ancient Near Eastern mythology. The creation story in Genesis 1 draws upon the Babylonian epic known as Enuma Elish. We'll be talking about that text in some depth. The story of the first human pair in the Garden of Eden, which is in Genesis 2 and 3 has clear affinities with the Epic of Gilgamesh, that's a Babylonian and Assyrian epic in which a hero embarks on this exhausting search for immortality. The story of Noah and the flood, which occurs in Genesis 6 through 9 is simply an Israelite version of an older flood story that we have found copies of: a Mesopotamian story called the Epic of Atrahasis [and] a flood story that we also have incorporated in the Epic of Gilgamesh. Biblical traditions have roots that stretch deep into earlier times and out into surrounding lands and traditions, and the parallels between the biblical stories and Ancient Near Eastern stories that they parallel has been the subject of intense study.\n\nHowever, it isn't just the similarity between the biblical materials and the Ancient Near Eastern sources that is important to us. In fact, in some ways it's the dissimilarity that is remarkably important to us, the biblical transformation of a common Near Eastern heritage in light of its radically new conceptions of God and the world and humankind. We'll be dealing with this in some depth, but I'll give you one quick example. We have a Sumerian story about the third millennium BCE, going back 3000 \u2014 third millennium, 3000 BCE. It's the story of Ziusudra, and it's very similar to the Genesis flood story of Noah. In both of these stories, the Sumerian and the Israelite story, you have a flood that is the result of a deliberate divine decision; one individual is chosen to be rescued; that individual is given very specific instructions on building a boat; he is given instructions about who to bring on board; the flood comes and exterminates all living things; the boat comes to rest on a mountaintop; the hero sends out birds to reconnoiter the land; when he comes out of the ark he offers a sacrifice to the god \u2014 the same narrative elements are in these two stories. It's just wonderful when you read them side by side. So what is of great significance though is not simply that the biblical writer is retelling a story that clearly went around everywhere in ancient Mesopotamia; they were transforming the story so that it became a vehicle for the expression of their own values and their own views. In the Mesopotamian stories, for example, the gods act capriciously, the gods act on a whim. In fact, in one of the stories, the gods say, \"Oh, people, they're so noisy, I can't sleep, let's wipe them all out.\" That's the rationale. There's no moral scruple. They destroy these helpless but stoic humans who are chafing under their tyrannical and unjust and uncaring rule. In the biblical story, when the Israelites told the story, they modified it. It's God's uncompromising ethical standards that lead him to bring the flood in an act of divine justice. He's punishing the evil corruption of human beings that he has so lovingly created and whose degradation he can't bear to witness. So it's saying something different. It's providing a very different message.\n\nSo when we compare the Bible with the literature of the Ancient Near East, we'll see not only the incredible cultural and literary heritage that was obviously common to them, but we'll see the ideological gulf that separated them and we'll see how biblical writers so beautifully and cleverly manipulated and used these stories, as I said, as a vehicle for the expression of a radically new idea. They drew upon these sources but they blended and shaped them in a particular way. And that brings us to a critical problem facing anyone who seeks to reconstruct ancient Israelite religion or culture on the basis of the biblical materials. That problem is the conflicting perspective between the final editors of the text and some of the older sources that are incorporated into the Bible, some of the older sources that they were obviously drawing on. Those who were responsible for the final editing, the final forms of the texts, had a decidedly monotheistic perspective, ethical monotheistic perspective, and they attempted to impose that perspective on their older source materials; and for the most part they were successful. But at times the result of their effort is a deeply conflicted, deeply ambiguous text. And again, that's going to be one of the most fun things for you as readers of this text, if you're alert to it, if you're ready to listen to the cacophony of voices that are within the text.\n\nIn many respects, the Bible represents or expresses a basic discontent with the larger cultural milieu in which it was produced, and that's interesting for us, because a lot of modern people have a tendency to think of the Bible as an emblem of conservatism. Right? We tend to think of this as an old fuddy-duddy document, it's outdated, has outdated ideas, and I think the challenge of this course is that you read the Bible with fresh eyes so that you can appreciate it for what it was, [and] in many ways what it continues to be: a revolutionary, cultural critique. We can read the Bible with fresh and appreciative eyes only if we first acknowledge and set aside some of our presuppositions about the Bible. It's really impossible, in fact, that you not have some opinions about this work, because it's an intimate part of our culture. So even if you've never opened it or read it yourself, I bet you can cite me a line or two \u2014 \"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,\" and I bet you don't really know what it means. \"The poor will always be with you\": I'm sure you don't really know what that means. These are things and phrases that we hear and they create within us a certain impression of the biblical text and how it functions. Verses are quoted, they're alluded to, whether to be championed and valorized or whether to be lampooned and pilloried. But we can feel that we have a rough idea of the Bible and a rough idea of its outlook when in fact what we really have are popular misconceptions that come from the way in which the Bible has been used or misused. Most of our cherished presuppositions about the Bible are based on astonishing claims that others have made on behalf of the Bible, claims that the Bible has not made on behalf of itself.\n\nSo before we proceed, I need to ask you to set aside for the purposes of this course, some of the more common myths about the Bible. I have a little list here for you. The first is the idea that the Bible's a book. It's not a book. We'll get rid of that one. The Bible is not a book with all that that implies, that it has a uniform style and a message and a single author, the sorts of things we think of when we think in a conventional sense of the word \"book.\" It's a library. It's an anthology of writings or books written and edited over an extensive period of time by people in very different situations responding to very different issues and stimuli, some political, some historical, some philosophical, some religious, some moral. There are many types or genres of material in the Bible. There's narrative, wonderful narrative stories. There's all kinds of law. There are cultic and ritual texts that prescribe how some ceremony is supposed to be performed. There are records of the messages of prophets. There's lyric poetry, there's love poetry, there are proverbs, there are psalms of thanksgiving and lament. So, there's a tremendous variety of material in this library, and it follows from the fact that it's not a book but an anthology of diverse works, that it's not an ideological monolith. And this is something a lot of students struggle with. Each book, or strand of tradition within a book, within the biblical collection sounds its own distinctive note in the symphony of reflection that is the Bible. Genesis is concerned to account for the origin of things and wrestles with the existence of evil, the existence of idolatry and suffering in a world that's created by a good god. The priestly texts in Leviticus and Numbers emphasize the sanctity of all life and the ideal of holiness and ethical and ritual purity. There are odes to human reason and learning and endeavor in the wisdom book of Proverbs. Ecclesiastes reads like an existentialist writing from the twentieth century. It scoffs at the vanity of all things, including wisdom, and espouses a kind of positive existentialism. The Psalms are very individual writings that focus on individual piety and love and worship of God. Job, possibly the greatest book of the Bible, I won't give away my preferences there, challenges conventional religious piety and arrives at the bittersweet conclusion that there is no justice in this world or any other, but that nonetheless we're not excused from the thankless and perhaps ultimately meaningless task of righteous living. One of the most wonderful and fortuitous facts of history is that later Jewish communities chose to put all this stuff in this collection we call the Bible. They chose to include all of these dissonant voices together. They didn't strive to reconcile the conflicts, nor should we. They didn't, we shouldn't. Each book, each writer, each voice reflects another thread in the rich tapestry of human experience, human response to life and its puzzles, human reflection on the sublime and the depraved.\n\nAnd that leads me to my second point, which is that biblical narratives are not pious parables about saints. Okay? Not pious tales. They're psychologically real literature about very real or realistic people and life situations. They're not stories about pious people whose actions are always exemplary and whose lives should be models for our own, despite what Sunday School curricula will often turn them into. And despite what they would have us believe. There is a genre of literature that details the lives of saints, Hagiography, but that came later and is largely something we find in the Christian era. It's not found in the Bible. The Bible abounds with human not superhuman beings, and their behavior can be scandalous. It can be violent, it can be rebellious, outrageous, lewd, vicious. But at the same time like real people, they can turn around and act in a way that is loyal and true above and beyond the call of duty. They can change, they can grow. But it's interesting to me that there are many people who, when they open the Bible for the first time, they close it in shock and disgust. Jacob is a deceiver; Joseph is an arrogant, spoiled brat; Judah reneges on his obligations to his daughter-in-law and goes off and sleeps with a prostitute. Who are these people? Why are they in the Bible? And the shock comes from the expectation that the heroes of the Bible are somehow being held up as perfect people. That's just not a claim that's made by the Bible itself. So biblical characters are real people with real, compelling moral conflicts and ambitions and desires, and they can act shortsightedly and selfishly. But they can also, like real people, learn and grow and change; and if we work too hard and too quickly to vindicate biblical characters just because they're in the Bible, then we miss all the good stuff. We miss all of the moral sophistication, the deep psychological insights that have made these stories of such timeless interest. So read it like you would read any good book with a really good author who knows how to make some really interesting characters.\n\nThirdly, the Bible's not for children. I have a 12-year-old and an 8-year-old. I won't let them read it. I won't let them read it. Those \"Bible Stories for Children\" books, they scare me. They really scare me. It's not suitable for children. The subject matter in the Bible is very adult, particularly in the narrative texts. There are episodes of treachery and incest and murder and rape. And the Bible is not for na\u00efve optimists. It's hard-hitting stuff. And it speaks to those who are courageous enough to acknowledge that life is rife with pain and conflict, just as it's filled with compassion and joy. It's not for children in another sense. Like any literary masterpiece, the Bible is characterized by a sophistication of structure and style and an artistry of theme and metaphor, and believe me, that's lost on adult readers quite often. It makes its readers work. The Bible doesn't moralize, or rarely, rarely moralizes. It explores moral issues and situations, puts people in moral issues and situations. The conclusions have to be drawn by the reader. There are also all kinds of paradoxes and subtle puns and ironies, and in section where you'll be doing a lot of your close reading work, those are some of the things that will be drawn to your attention. You'll really begin to appreciate them in time.\n\nThe fourth myth we want to get rid of: the Bible is not a book of theology, it's not a catechism or a book of systematic theology. It's not a manual of religion, despite the fact that at a much later time, very complex systems of theology are going to be spun from particular interpretations of biblical passages. You know, there's nothing in the Bible that really corresponds to prevailing modern western notions of religion, what we call religion, and indeed there's no word for religion in the language of biblical Hebrew. There just isn't a word \"religion.\" With the rise of Christianity, western religion came to be defined to a large degree by the confession of, or the intellectual assent to, certain doctrinal points of belief. Religion became defined primarily as a set of beliefs, a catechism of beliefs or truths that required your assent, what I think of as the catechism kind of notion of religion. That's entirely alien to the world of the Bible. It's clear that in biblical times and in the Ancient Near East generally, religion wasn't a set of doctrines that you ascribed to. To become an Israelite, later on a Jew \u2014 the word \"Jew\" isn't something we can really historically use until about this time [ca. 500 BCE], so most of our period we're going to be talking about the ancient Israelites \u2014 to become an Israelite, you simply joined the Israelite community, you lived an Israelite life, you died an Israelite death. You obeyed Israelite law and custom, you revered Israelite lore, you entered into the historical community of Israel by accepting that their fate and yours should be the same. It was sort of a process of naturalization, what we think of today as naturalization. So the Hebrew Bible just isn't a theological textbook. It contains a lot of narratives and its narrative materials are an account of the odyssey of a people, the nation of Israel. They're not an account of the divine, which is what theology means, an account of the divine. However, having said this, I should add that although the Bible doesn't contain formal statements of religious belief or systematic theology, it treats issues, many moral issues and some existential issues that are central to the later discipline of theology, but it treats them very differently. Its treatment of these issues is indirect, it's implicit. It uses the language of story and song and poetry and paradox and metaphor. It uses a language and a style that's very far from the language and style of later philosophy and abstract theology.\n\nFinally, on our myth count, I would point out \u2014 well I don't really need to cross this out, this is something to discuss \u2014 I would point out that the Bible was formulated and assembled and edited and modified and censored and transmitted first orally and then in writing by human beings. The Bible itself doesn't claim to have been written by God. That belief is a religious doctrine of a much later age. And even then one wonders how literally it was meant \u2014 it's interesting to go back and look at some of the earliest claims about the origin of the biblical text. Similarly, the so-called five books of Moses \u2014 Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, the first five books we call the Pentateuch of Moses \u2014 nowhere claim to have been written in their entirety by Moses. That's not something they say themselves. Some laws in Exodus, you know, the Book of the Covenant, a few things \u2014 yes, it says Moses wrote those down, but not the whole five books that tradition later will ascribe to him. The Bible clearly had many contributors over many centuries, and the individual styles and concerns of those writers, their political and religious motivations, betray themselves frequently.\n\nI leave aside here the question of divine inspiration, which is an article of faith in many biblical religions. It's no doubt an article of faith for people in this very room. But there is no basic incompatibility between believing on faith in the divine inspiration of the Bible and acknowledging the role that human beings have played in the actual formulation and editing and transmission and preservation of that same Bible. And since this is a university course and not perhaps a theological course or within a theological setting, it's really only the latter, the demonstrably human component, that will concern us.\n\nIt's very easy for me to assert that our interest in the Hebrew Bible will be centered on the culture and the history and the literature and the religious thought of ancient Israel in all of its diversity rather than questions of faith and theology. But the fact remains that the document is the basis for the religious faith of many millions of people, and some of them are here now. It is inevitable that you will bring what you learn in this course into dialogue with your own personal religious beliefs, and for some of you, I hope all of you, that will be enriching and exciting. For some of you it may be difficult. I know that, and I want you to rest assured that no one in this course wishes to undermine or malign religious faith any more than they wish to promote or proselytize for religious faith. Religious faith simply isn't the topic of this course. The rich history and literature and religious thought of ancient Israel as preserved for us over millennia in the pages of this remarkable volume, that is our topic, and so our approach is going to be necessarily academic; and especially given the diversity of people in this room, that's really all that it can be, so that we have a common ground and common goals for our discussions. But it has been my experience that from time to time students will raise a question or ask a question that is prompted by a commitment, a prior commitment to an article of faith. Sometimes they're not even aware that that's what they're doing, and I want you to understand that on those occasions I'll most likely respond by inviting you to consider the article of faith that lies behind that question and is creating that particular problem for you. I'm not going to be drawn into a philosophical or theological debate over the merits of that belief, but I'll simply point out how or why that belief might be making it difficult for you to read or accept what the text is actually and not ideally saying, and leave you to think about that. And I see those as wonderful learning opportunities for the class. Those are in no way a problem for me.\n\nAll right, so let's give a few sort of necessary facts and figures now about the Bible and then I need to talk a little bit about the organization of the course. So those are the last two things we really need to do. An overview of the structure of the Bible. So you have a couple of handouts that should help you here. So, the Bible is this assemblage of books and writings dating from approximately 1000 BCE \u2014 we're going to hear very diverse opinions about how far back this stuff dates \u2014 down to the second century: the last book within the Hebrew Bible was written in the 160s BCE. Some of these books which we think are roughly from a certain date, they will contain narrative snippets or legal materials or oral traditions that may even date back or stretch back further in time, and they were perhaps transmitted orally and then ended up in these written forms. The Bible is written largely in Hebrew, hence the name Hebrew Bible. There are a few passages in Aramaic. So you have a handout that breaks down the three major components. It's the one that's written two columns per page. Okay? We're going to talk in a minute about those three sections, so you want to have that handy.\n\nThese writings have had a profound and lasting impact on three world religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. For the Jewish communities who first compiled these writings in the pre-Christian era, the Bible was perhaps first and foremost a record of God's eternal covenant with the Jewish people. So Jews refer to the Bible as the Tanakh. It's the term you see up here. It should be also on that sheet, Tanakh, which is really the letter [sounds] \"t\", \"n\" and \"kh\", and they've put little \"a's\" in there to make it easy to pronounce, because kh is hard to pronounce, so Tanach. Okay? And this is an acronym. The T stands for Torah, which is a word that means instruction or teaching. It's often translated \"law\"; I think that's a very poor translation. It means instruction, way, teaching, and that refers to the first five books that you see listed here, Genesis through Deuteronomy. The second division of the Bible is referred to as Nevi'im, which is the Hebrew word for \"prophets.\" The section of the Prophets is divided really into two parts, because there are two types of writing in the prophetic section of the Bible. The first or former Prophets continues the kind of narrative prose account of the history of Israel, focusing on the activities of Israel's prophets. All right? So, the Former Prophets are narrative texts. The Latter Prophets are poetic and oracular writings that bear the name of the prophet to whom the writings are ascribed. You have the three major prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel, and then the twelve minor prophets, which in the Hebrew Bible get counted together as one book, because those twelve are very small. The final section of the Bible is referred to asKetuvim in Hebrew, which simply means \"Writings,\" and that's probably about 50% of the Hebrew you're going to get in the whole course, so please don't be scared. You know, I've got two or three other terms that'll be useful along the way, but there's really no need to know Hebrew. I just want you to understand why Tanakh is the word that's used to refer to the Bible. So the Ketuvim, or the Writings, are really a miscellany. They contain works of various types, and the three parts correspond very roughly to the process of canonization or authoritativeness for the community. The Torah probably reached a fixed and authoritative status first, then the books of the Prophets and finally the Writings. And probably by the end of the first century, all of this was organized in some way.\n\nIf you look at the other handout, you'll see, however, that any course on the Bible is going to run immediately into the problem of defining the object of study, because different Bibles served different communities over the centuries. One of the earliest translations of the Hebrew Bible was a translation into Greek known as the Septuagint. It was written for the benefit \u2014 it was translated for the benefit of Jews who lived in Alexandria \u2014 Greek-speaking Jews who lived in Alexandria, Egypt in the Hellenistic period somewhere around the third or second century BCE. The translation has some divergences with the traditional Hebrew text of the Bible as we now have it, including the order of the books, and some of these things are charted for you on the chart that I've handed out. The Septuagint's rationale for ordering the books is temporal. They've clustered books Genesis through Esther, which tell of things past; the books of Job through the Song of Songs or the Song of Solomon contain wisdom that applies to the present; and then the prophetic books, Isaiah to Malachi, contain or tell of things future. Some copies of the Septuagint contain some books not included in the Hebrew canon but accepted in the early Christian canon. The Septuagint, the Greek translation, became by and large the Bible of Christianity, or more precisely it became the \"Old Testament\" of the Hebrew Bible [correction: Professor Hayes meant to say Christian Bible instead of Hebrew Bible here]. The church adopted the Hebrew Bible as a precursor to its largely Hellenistic gospels. It was an important association for it, with an old and respected tradition. Our primary concern is the Bible of the ancient Israelite and Jewish community \u2014 the 24 books grouped in the Torah, Prophets and Writings on that other sheet \u2014 which is common to all Bibles. Whether Jewish or Christian, those 24 are the baseline common books. So those are the 24 that we're going to focus on.\n\nBecause the term \"Old Testament\" is a theologically loaded term, it sort of suggests the doctrine that the New Testament has somehow fulfilled or surpassed or antiquated the Bible of ancient Israel, you're going to hear me refer to the object of our study as the Hebrew Bible. You may certainly use any other term, and you may certainly use the term Old Testament, as long as it's clear we're talking about this set of 24 books and not some of the other things that are in the Old Testament that aren't in the traditional Hebrew Bible. It means you're studying less, so that might be a good thing. So, it's fine with me if you want to use that but I will prefer the more accurate term \"Hebrew Bible.\" Also while we're on terminology, you'll notice that I use BCE to refer to the period before 0 and CE to refer to the period after 0; the Common Era and Before the Common Era, and in a lot of your secondary readings and writings they'll be using the same thing. It corresponds to what you know as BC, Before Christ, and Anno Domini, AD, the year of our Lord. It's just a non-Christian-centric way of dating and in a lot of your secondary readings you'll see it, so you should get used to it: BCE and CE, Before the Common Era and the Common Era.\n\nFrom earliest times, Christians made use of the Bible but almost always in its Greek translation, and the Christian Old Testament contains some material not in the Hebrew Bible, as I've mentioned. And some of these works are referred to as the Apocrypha \u2014 so [some of] you will have heard that term. These are writings that were composed somewhere around here, sort of 200 BCE to 100 CE. They were widely used by Jews of the period. They simply weren't considered to be of the same status as the 24 books. [beeping noise] I'm glad they pick up the garbage at 11:10 [laughs] on Wednesday mornings. But they did become part of the canon of Catholic Christianity and in the sixteenth century, their canonical status was confirmed for the Catholic Church. With the Renaissance and the Reformation, some Christians became interested in Hebrew versions of the Bible. They wanted to look at the Hebrew and not the Greek translation from the Hebrew. Protestants, the Protestant church, denied canonical status to the books of the Apocrypha. They said they were important for pious instruction but excluded them from their canon. There are also some works you may know of, referred to as the Pseudepigrapha \u2014 we'll talk about some of these things in a little more detail later \u2014 from roughly the same period; [they] tend to be a little more apocalyptic in nature, and they were never part of the Jewish or the Catholic canon, but there are some eastern Christian groups that have accepted them in their canon. The point I'm trying to make is that there are very many sacred canons out there that are cherished by very many religious communities, and they're all designated \"Bibles.\" So again, we're focusing on that core set of 24 books that are common to all Bibles everywhere, the 24 books of what would in fact be the Jewish Tanakh.\n\nNot only has there been variety regarding the scope of the biblical canon in different communities, but there's been some fluidity in the actual text itself. We don't, of course, have any original copies of these materials as they came off the pen of whoever it was who was writing them, and in fact before the middle of the twentieth century, our oldest manuscripts and fragments of manuscripts of the Bible dated to the year 900. That's an awful long distance from the events they're talking about. And we've got to think about that, right? You've got to think about that and what it means and how were they transmitted and preserved without the means of technology, obviously, that we have today; and what was so exciting in the middle of the twentieth century was the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls. I'm sure that you've heard of them. They brought about a dramatic change in the state of our knowledge of our Hebrew manuscript evidence. The Dead Sea Scrolls were found in caves in the Judean desert. We used to think they were a library of a sectarian community; now I think they think it was a pottery factory or something. So maybe they were just shoved there by people fleeing the Roman conquest in 70 [see note 1].\n\nSo that's up for grabs. But we have this really great collection of scrolls, and among them we have found an almost complete copy of every book of the Bible. Sorry \u2014 almost complete copy of the Book of Isaiah and then partial copies or fragments of all of the biblical books, except maybe Esther. Am I wrong about that? I don't think there's an Esther from Qumran, I think that's the only one. [This is correct. No book of Esther has been found among the Dead Sea Scrolls.] And some of them date back to the fourth and third century [BCE]. So do you understand now why everybody was so excited? Suddenly, we have evidence, thirteen or fourteen hundred years earlier, that people were reading this stuff and, by and large, it's a pretty constant textual tradition. Sure there are differences, sure there are differences. We see that our manuscripts are not exactly like those fragments, but there is a remarkable degree, a high degree of correspondence so that we really can speak of a relatively stable textual tradition but still some fluidity. And that's going to be interesting for us to think about.\n\nThere are many translations of the Bible, but I would like you to purchase for this course the Jewish Study Bible [see References]. So let me turn now to just some of the administrative, organizational details of the course, the secondary readings that we'll be using. I'm asking you to pick up the Jewish Study Bible not only for the translation of the Tanakh, which is a very good translation, but because it contains wonderful scholarly articles in the back. It used to be we had a course packet for this course that was two volumes, and now with the purchase of this, I've been able to really consolidate the readings. They're really wonderful; great introductions to the individual books of the Bible and so I think you will find that this will become like a Bible to you [laughs]. So you need to pick that up. It's at the Yale bookstore. I also would like you to pick up this paperback, it's not terribly expensive. We're going to be using it in the first few weeks especially: The Ancient Near East [see References]. Other readings, the secondary readings for the course, are all already online [for on-campus students]. I will be also making them available at Allegra [bookstore] for people who would like to just purchase them already printed out so you don't do it yourself, but I know some people really prefer to work online \u2014 and certainly for the first week of reading, you can get started because it is online. I don't think things will be available at Allegra's until probably tomorrow afternoon.\n\nThe syllabus. As you can see, it's a pretty thick syllabus, but it's divided into a schedule of lectures and then a schedule of readings. All right? So, understand that there are two distinct things there. It's not just all the scheduled lectures. The last few pages are a schedule of the actual readings, and the assignment that you'll have for the weekend and for next week's lectures are the readings by Kaufman. I really, really need you to read that before the next class, and I want you to read it critically. Kaufman's ideas are important, but they are also overstated, and so they're going to be interesting for us. We're going to wrestle with his claims quite a bit during the course of the semester. The secondary readings are heavier at the beginning of the course when we are reading very small segments of biblical text. That will shift. Right? Towards the end of the course you're going to be reading, you know, a couple of books in the Bible and maybe a ten-page article of secondary reading; so, you know, it's front loaded with secondary readings. So you'll want to get started on the Kaufman, because for the first few weeks it's quite a bit of secondary reading but we're covering just a few chapters of Bible each time in the first few weeks.\n\nSections: We're going to be doing this online registration thing that I've never done before, so I hope it works. We do have three teaching fellows for this course. I hope that will be sufficient. Actually, if the teaching fellows could stand up so people could at least recognize you, that would be wonderful. Anyone wants to volunteer, we could have a fourth. Okay, so we have two in the back there, we have Tudor Sala raising his hand and Tzvi Novick here. They will be running regular discussion sections and then Kristine Garroway will be running a writing requirement section. I don't think that was listed in the Blue Book [Yale College Programs of Study], but it should've been listed online that it is possible to fulfill your writing skills requirement through this course. So Kristine will be running that. We will bring on Monday \u2014 so please have your schedules as well-formed as they are, on Monday \u2014 we will put up times and we will take a straw poll to figure out if we can accommodate everybody within the times.\n\nOne more extremely important announcement, it's on your syllabus, but I want to underline it even more than it is already underlined and boldfaced. I want to underline the importance of the section discussions in this course. In fact, it's really wrong to call them section discussions. It sounds like you're discussing the lectures and the readings and you're really not. The section discussions are a complement to the lectures. What I mean is: this is an awfully big thing to spend just one semester studying, and I can't do it all, and in my lectures I'll be trying to set broad themes and patterns and describe what's going on, but I want you to have the experience of actually sitting and reading chunks of text and struggling with that and understanding the history of interpretation of passages and how so many important things have happened historically because of people's efforts to understand this text. So in sections, a large part of the focus in section will be on specific passages, reading and struggling with the text, the kind of thing I can't do in lecture. This is important because your final paper assignment will be an exercise in exegesis, an interpretation. The skills that you will need for that paper I am fairly certain are not things that you would've acquired in high school and, if we have some upperclassmen \u2014 I don't know, but maybe not even some upperclassmen will have acquired here yet. Exegesis is a very particular kind of skill and the teaching fellows will be introducing you to methods of exegesis. So it's really a training ground for the final paper, and we have found that people don't succeed in the course in the final paper without the training they get in section discussion, which is why section participation is worth ten percent of your grade. However, if there are repeated, unexcused absences, there will be an adjustment in the grade calculation, and it will be worth twenty to twenty-five percent of your grade, and it will be a negative grade also. And believe me, this is a favor to you. It is definitely a favor to you. These sections are critically important in this course. Okay? So, if you have any questions, I can hang around for a few minutes, but thank you for coming.

For instance, did you know that some modern dictionaries are notoriously liberal and others notoriously conservative, and that certain conservative dictionaries were actually conceived and designed as corrective responses to the \"corruption\" and \"permissiveness\" of certain liberal dictionaries? That the oligarchic device of having a special \"Distinguished Usage Panel ... of outstanding professional speakers and writers\" is an attempted compromise between the forces of egalitarianism and traditionalism in English, but that most linguistic liberals dismiss the Usage Panel as mere sham-populism? Did you know that U.S. lexicography even had a seamy underbelly?\n\nThe occasion for this article is Oxford University Press's semi-recent release of Bryan A. Garner's A Dictionary of Modern American Usage. The fact of the matter is that Garner's dictionary is extremely good, certainly the most comprehensive usage guide since E. W. Gilman's Webster's Dictionary of English Usage, now a decade out of date.[1] Its format, like that of Gilman and the handful of other great American usage guides of the last century, includes entries on individual words and phrases and expostulative small-cap MINI-ESSAYS. on any issue broad enough to warrant more general discussion. But the really distinctive and ingenious features of A Dictionary of Modern American Usage involve issues of rhetoric and ideology and style, and it is impossible to describe why these issues are important and why Garner's management of them borders on genius without talking about the historical contexts [2] in which ADMAU appears, and this context turns out to be a veritable hurricane of controversies involving everything from technical linguistics to public education to political ideology, and these controversies take a certain amount of time to unpack before their relation to what makes Garner's usage guide so eminently worth your hard-earned reference-book dollar can even be established; and in fact there's no way even to begin the whole harrowing polymeric discussion without taking a moment to establish and define the highly colloquial term SNOOT.\n\nFrom one perspective, a certain irony attends the publication of any good new book on American usage. It is that the people who are going to be interested in such a book are also the people who are least going to need it, i.e., that offering counsel on the finer points of U.S. English is Preaching to the Choir. The relevant Choir here comprises that small percentage of American citizens who actually care about the current status of double modals and ergative verbs. The same sorts of people who watched Story of English on PBS (twice) and read W. Safire's column with their half-caff every Sunday. The sorts of people who feel that special blend of wincing despair and sneering superiority when they see EXPRESS LANE \u2014 10 ITEMS OR LESS or hear dialogue used as a verb or realize that the founders of the Super 8 motel chain must surely have been ignorant of the meaning of suppurate. There are lots of epithets for people like this \u2014 Grammar Nazis, Usage Nerds, Syntax Snobs, the Language Police. The term I was raised with is SNOOT.[3] The word might be slightly self-mocking, but those other terms are outright dysphemisms. A SNOOT can be defined as somebody who knows what dysphemism means and doesn't mind letting you know it.\n\nI submit that we SNOOTs are just about the last remaining kind of truly elitist nerd. There are, granted, plenty of nerd-species in today's America, and some of these are elitist within their own nerdy purview (e.g., the skinny, carbuncular, semi-autistic Computer Nerd moves instantly up on the totem pole of status when your screen freezes and now you need his help, and the bland condescension with which he performs the two occult keystrokes that unfreeze your screen is both elitist and situationally valid). But the SNOOT's purview is interhuman social life itself. You don't, after all (despite withering cultural pressure), have to use a computer, but you can't escape language: Language is everything and everywhere; it's what lets us have anything to do with one another; it's what separates us from the animals; Genesis 11:7-10 and so on. And we SNOOTS know when and how to hyphenate phrasal adjectives and to keep participles from dangling, and we know that we know, and we know how very few other Americans know this stuff or even care, and we judge them accordingly.\n\nIn ways that certain of us are uncomfortable about, SNOOTs' attitudes about contemporary usage resemble religious/political conservatives' attitudes about contemporary culture:[4] We combine a missionary zeal and a near-neural faith in our beliefs' importance with a curmudgeonly hell-in-a-handbasket despair at the way English is routinely manhandled and corrupted by supposedly educated people. The Evil is all around us: boners and clunkers and solecistic howlers and bursts of voguish linguistic methane that make any SNOOT's cheek twitch and forehead darken. A fellow SNOOT I know likes to say that listening to most people's English feels like watching somebody use a Stradivarius to pound nails. We[5] are the Few, the Proud, the Appalled at Everyone Else.\n\nTHESIS STATEMENT FOR WHOLE ARTICLE\n\nIssues of tradition vs. egalitarianism in U.S. English are at root political issues and can be effectively addressed only in what this article hereby terms a \"Democratic Spirit.\" A Democratic Spirit is one that combines rigor and humility, i.e., passionate conviction plus sedulous respect for the convictions of others. As any American knows, this is a very difficult spirit to cultivate and maintain, particularly when it comes to issues you feel strongly about. Equally tough is a D.S.'s criterion of 100 percent intellectual integrity \u2014 you have to be willing to look honestly at yourself and your motives for believing what you believe, and to do it more or less continually.\n\nThis kind of stuff is advanced U.S. citizenship. A true Democratic Spirit is up there with religious faith and emotional maturity and all those other top-of-the-Maslow-Pyramid-type qualities people spend their whole lives working on. A Democratic Spirit's constituent rigor and humility and honesty are in fact so hard to maintain on certain issues that it's almost irresistibly tempting to fall in with some established dogmatic camp and to follow that camp's line on the issue and to let your position harden within the camp and become inflexible and to believe that any other camp is either evil or insane and to spend all your time and energy trying to shout over them.\n\nI submit, then, that it is indisputably easier to be dogmatic than Democratic, especially about issues that are both vexed and highly charged. I submit further that the issues surrounding \"correctness\" in contemporary American usage are both vexed and highly charged, and that the fundamental questions they involve are ones whose answers have to be \"worked out\" instead of simply found.\n\nA distinctive feature of ADMAU is that its author is willing to acknowledge that a usage dictionary is not a bible or even a textbook but rather just the record of one smart person's attempts to work out answers to certain very difficult questions. This willingness appears to me to be informed by a Democratic Spirit. The big question is whether such a spirit compromises Garner's ability to present himself as a genuine \"authority\" on issues of usage. Assessing Garner's book, then, involves trying to trace out the very weird and complicated relationship between Authority and Democracy in what we as a culture have decided is English. That relationship is, as many educated Americans would say, still in process at this time.\n\nA Dictionary of Modern American Usage has no Editorial Staff or Distinguished Panel. It's conceived, researched, and written ab ovo usque ad mala by Bryan Garner. This is an interesting guy. He's both a lawyer and a lexicographer (which seems a bit like being both a narcotics dealer and a DEA agent). His 1987 A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage is already a minor classic; now, instead of practicing law anymore, he goes around conducting writing seminars for J.D.'s and doing prose-consulting for various judicial bodies. Garner's also the founder of something called the H. W. Fowler Society,[6] a worldwide group of usage-Trekkies who like to send one another linguistic boners clipped from different periodicals. You get the idea. This Garner is one serious and very hard-core SNOOT.\n\nThe lucid, engaging, and extremely sneaky Preface to ADMAU serves to confirm Garner's SNOOTitude in fact while undercutting it in tone. For one thing, whereas the traditional usage pundit cultivates a sort of remote and imperial persona \u2014 the kind who uses one or we to refer to himself \u2014 Garner gives us an almost Waltonishly endearing sketch of his own background:\n\nI realized early at the age of 15[7] \u2014 that my primary\nintellectual interest was the use of the English language....\nIt became an all-consuming passion.... I read everything\nI could find on the subject. Then, on a wintry evening\nwhile visiting New Mexico at the age of 16, I discovered\nEric Partridge's Usage and Abusage. I was enthralled.\nNever had I held a more exciting book.... Suffice it\nto say that by the time I was 18, I had committed to\nmemory most of Fowler, Partridge, and their successors....\n\nAlthough this reviewer regrets the biosketch's failure to mention the rather significant social costs of being an adolescent whose overriding passion is English usage,[8] the critical hat is off to yet another personable section of the Preface, one that Garner entitles \"First Principles\": \"Before going any further, I should explain my approach. That's an unusual thing for the author of a usage dictionary to do \u2014 unprecedented, as far as I know. But a guide to good writing is only as good as the principles on which it's based. And users should be naturally interested in those principles. So, in the interests of full disclosure ...\"[9]\n\nThe \"unprecedented\" and \"full disclosure\" here are actually good-natured digs at Garner's Fowlerite predecessors, and a subtle nod to one camp in the wars that have raged in both lexicography and education ever since the notoriously liberal Webster's Third New International Dictionary came out in 1961 and included such terms as heighth and irregardless without any monitory labels on them. You can think of Webster's Third as sort of the Fort Sumter of the contemporary Usage Wars. These Wars are both the context and the target of a very subtle rhetorical strategy in A Dictionary of Modern American Usage, and without talking about them it's impossible to explain why Garner's book is both so good and so sneaky.\n\nWe regular citizens tend to go to The Dictionary for authoritative guidance.[10] Rarely, however, do we ask ourselves who decides what gets in The Dictionary or what words or spellings or pronunciations get deemed \"substandard\" or \"incorrect.\" Whence the authority of dictionary-makers to decide what's OK[11] and what isn't? Nobody elected them, after all. And simply appealing to precedent or tradition won't work, because what's considered correct changes over time. In the 1600s, for instance, the second-singular pronoun took a singular conjugation \u2014 \"You is.\" Earlier still, the standard 2-S pronoun wasn't \"you\" but \"thou\". Huge numbers of now acceptable words like clever, fun, banter, and prestigious entered English as what usage authorities considered errors or egregious slang. And not just usage conventions but English itself changes over time; if it didn't, we'd all still be talking like Chaucer. Who's to say which changes are natural and which are corruptions? And when Bryan Garner or E. Ward Gilman do in fact presume to say, why should we believe them?\n\nThese sorts of questions are not new, but they do now have a certain urgency. America is in the midst of a protracted Crisis of Authority in matters of language. In brief, the same sorts of political upheavals that produced everything from Kent State to Independent Counsels have produced an influential contra-SNOOT school for whom normative standards of English grammar and usage are functions of nothing but custom and superstition and the ovine docility of a populace that lets self-appointed language authorities boss them around. See for example MIT's Steven Pinker in a famous New Republic article \u2014 \"Once introduced, a prescriptive rule is very hard to eradicate, no matter how ridiculous. Inside the writing establishment, the rules survive by the same dynamic that perpetuates ritual genital mutilations\" \u2014 or, at a somewhat lower pitch, Bill Bryson in Mother Tongue: English and How It Got That Way:\n\nWho sets down all those rules that we all know\nabout from childhood: the idea that we must never\nend a sentence with a preposition or begin one with\na conjunction, that we must use \"each other\" for two\nthings and \"one another\" for more than two ...? The\nanswer, surprisingly often, is that no one does,\nthat when you look into the background of these\n\"rules\" there is often little basis for them.\n\nIn ADMAU's Preface, Garner himself addresses the Authority Question with a Trumanesque simplicity and candor that simultaneously disguise the author's cunning and exemplify it:\n\nAs you might already suspect, I don't shy away\nfrom making judgments. I can't imagine that most\nreaders would want me to. Linguists don't like it,\nof course, because judgment involves subjectivity.[12]\nIt isn't scientific. But rhetoric and usage, in the view\nof most professional writers, aren't scientific endeavors.\nYou don't want dispassionate descriptions; you want\nsound guidance. And that requires judgment.\n\nWhole monographs could be written just on the masterful rhetoric of this passage. Note for example the ingenious equivocation of judgment in \"I don't shy away from making judgments\" vs. \"And that requires judgment.\" Suffice it to say that Garner is at all times keenly aware of the Authority Crisis in modern usage; and his response to this crisis is in the best Democratic Spirit rhetorical.\n\nSo ...\n\nCOROLLARY TO THESIS STATEMENT FOR WHOLE ARTICLE\n\nThe most salient and timely feature of Garner's book is that it's both lexicographical and rhetorical. Its main strategy involves what is known in classical rhetoric as the Ethical Appeal. Here the adjective, derived from the Greek ethos, doesn't mean quite what we usually mean by ethical. But there are affinities. What the Ethical Appeal amounts to is a complex and sophisticated \"Trust me.\" It's the boldest, most ambitious, and also most distinctively American of rhetorical Appeals, because it requires the rhetor to convince us not just of his intellectual acuity or technical competence but of his basic decency and fairness and sensitivity to the audience's own hopes and fears.[13]\n\nThese are not qualities one associates with the traditional SNOOT usage-authority, a figure who pretty much instantiates snobbishness and bow-tied anality, and one whose modern image is not improved by stuff like American Heritage Dictionary Distinguished Usage Panelist Morris Bishop's \"The arrant solecisms of the ignoramus are here often omitted entirely, `irregardless' of how he may feel about this neglect\" or critic John Simon's \"The English language is being treated nowadays exactly as slave traders once handled their merchandise....\" Compare those lines' authorial personas with Garner's in, e.g., \"English usage is so challenging that even experienced writers need guidance now and then.\"\n\nThe thrust here is going to be that A Dictionary of Modern American Usage earns Garner pretty much all the trust his Ethical Appeal asks us for. The book's \"feel-good\" spirit (in the very best sense of \"feel-good\") marries rigor and humility in such a way as to allow Garner to be extremely prescriptive without any appearance of evangelism or elitist putdown. This is an extraordinary accomplishment. Understanding why it's basically a rhetorical accomplishment, and why this is both historically significant and (in this reviewer's opinion) politically redemptive, requires a more detailed look at the Usage Wars.\n\nYou'd sure know lexicography had an underbelly if you read the little introductory essays in modern dictionaries \u2014 pieces like Webster's DEU's \"A Brief History of English Usage\" or Webster's Third's \"Linguistic Advances and Lexicography\" or AHD-3's \"Usage in the American Heritage Dictionary: The Place of Criticism.\" But almost nobody ever bothers with these little intros, and it's not just their six-point type or the fact that dictionaries tend to be hard on the lap. It's that these intros aren't actually written for you or me or the average citizen who goes to The Dictionary just to see how to spell (for instance) meringue. They're written for other lexicographers and critics, and in fact they're not really introductory at all but polemical. They're salvos in the Usage Wars that have been under way ever since editor Philip Gove first sought to apply the value-neutral principles of structural linguistics to lexicography in Webster's Third. Gove's famous response to conservatives who howled[14] when Webster's Third endorsed OK and described ain't as \"used orally in most parts of the U.S. by many cultivated speakers [sic]\" was this: \"A dictionary should have no traffic with ... artificial notions of correctness or superiority. It should be descriptive and not prescriptive.\" These terms stuck and turned epithetic, and linguistic conservatives are now formally known as Prescriptivists and linguistic liberals as Descriptivists.\n\nThe former are far better known. When you read the columns of William Safire or Morton Freeman or books like Edwin Newman's Strictly Speaking or John Simon's Paradigms Lost, you're actually reading Popular Prescriptivism, a genre sideline of certain journalists (mostly older ones, the vast majority of whom actually do wear bow ties) whose bemused irony often masks a Colonel Blimp's rage at the way the beloved English of their youth is being trashed in the decadent present. The plutocratic tone and styptic wit of Safire and Newman and the best of the Prescriptivists is often modeled after the mandarin-Brit personas of Eric Partridge and H. W. Fowler, the same Twin Towers of scholarly Prescriptivism whom Garner talks about revering as a kid.[15]\n\nDescriptivists, on the other hand, don't have weekly columns in the Times. These guys tend to be hard-core academics, mostly linguists or Comp theorists. Loosely organized under the banner of structural (or \"descriptive\") linguistics, they are doctrinaire positivists who have their intellectual roots in the work of Auguste Comte and Ferdinand de Saussure and their ideological roots firmly in the U.S. sixties. The brief explicit mention Garner's Preface gives this crew \u2014\n\nSomewhere along the line, though, usage dictionaries\ngot hijacked by the descriptive linguists.[16] who observe\nlanguage scientifically. For the pure descriptivist, it's\nimpermissible to say that one form of language is\nany better than another: as long as a native speaker\nsays it, it's OK \u2014 and anyone who takes a contrary\nstand is a dunderhead.... Essentially, descriptivists and\nprescriptivists are approaching different problems.\nDescriptivists want to record language as it's actually\nused, and they perform a useful function \u2014 though\ntheir audience is generally limited to those willing to pore\nthrough vast tomes of dry-as-dust research.\n\n\u2014 is disingenuous in the extreme, especially the \"approaching different problems\" part, because it vastly underplays the Descriptivists' influence on U.S. culture. For one thing, Descriptivism so quickly and thoroughly took over English education in this country that just about everybody who started junior high after c. 1970 has been taught to write Descriptively \u2014 via \"freewriting,\" \"brainstorming,\" \"journaling,\" a view of writing as self-exploratory and -expressive rather than as communicative, an abandonment of systematic grammar, usage, semantics, rhetoric, etymology. For another thing, the very language in which today's socialist, feminist, minority, gay, and environmentalist movements frame their sides of political debates is informed by the Descriptivist belief that traditional English is conceived and perpetuated by Privileged WASP Males[17] and is thus inherently capitalist, sexist, racist, xenophobic, homophobic, elitist: unfair. Think Ebonics. Think of the involved contortions people undergo to avoid he as a generic pronoun, or of the tense deliberate way white males now adjust their vocabularies around non-w.m.'s. Think of today's endless battles over just the names of things \u2014 \"Affirmative Action\" vs. \"Reverse Discrimination,\" \"Pro-Life\" vs. \"Pro-Choice,\" \"Undercount\" vs. \"Vote Fraud,\" etc.\n\nThe Descriptivist revolution takes a little time to unpack, but it's worth it. The structural linguists' rejection of conventional usage rules depends on two main arguments. The first is academic and methodological. In this age of technology, Descriptivists contend, it's the Scientific Method \u2014 clinically objective, value-neutral, based on direct observation and demonstrable hypothesis \u2014 that should determine both the content of dictionaries and the standards of \"correct\" English. Because language is constantly evolving, such standards will always be fluid. Gore's now classic introduction to Webster's Third outlines this type of Descriptivism's five basic edicts:\n\n\"1 \u2014 Language changes constantly;\n\n2 \u2014 Change is normal;\n\n3 \u2014 Spoken language is the language;\n\n4 \u2014 Correctness rests upon usage;\n\n5 \u2014 All usage is relative.\"\n\nThese principles look prima facie OK \u2014 commonsensical and couched in the bland simple s.-v.-o, prose of dispassionate Science \u2014 but in fact they're vague and muddled and it takes about three seconds to think of reasonable replies to each one of them, viz.:\n\n1 \u2014 OK, but how much and how fast?\n\n2 \u2014 Same thing. Is Heraclitean flux as normal or desirable as gradual change ? Do some changes actually serve the language's overall pizzazz better than others? And how many people have to deviate from how many conventions before we say the language has actually changed? Fifty percent? Ten percent?\n\n3 \u2014 This is an old claim, at least as old as Plato's Phaedrus. And it's specious. If Derrida and the infamous Deconstructionists have done nothing else, they've debunked the idea that speech is language's primary instantiation.[18] Plus consider the weird arrogance of Gove's (3) w/r/t correctness. Only the most mullahlike Prescriptivists care very much about spoken English; most Prescriptive usage guides concern Standard Written English.[19]\n\n4 \u2014 Fine, but whose usage? Gove's (4) begs the whole question. What he wants to imply here, I think, is a reversal of the traditional entailment-relation between abstract rules and concrete usage: Instead of usage ideally corresponding to a rigid set of regulations, the regulations ought to correspond to the way real people are actually using the language. Again, fine, but which people? Urban Latinos? Boston Brahmins? Rural Midwesterners? Appalachian Neogaelics?\n\n5 \u2014 Huh? If this means what it seems to mean, then it ends up biting Gove's whole argument in the ass. (5) appears to imply that the correct answer to the above \"which people?\" is: \"All of them!\" And it's easy to show why this will not stand up as a lexicographical principle. The most obvious problem with it is that not everything can go in The Dictionary. Why not? Because you can't observe every last bit of every last native speaker's \"language behavior,\" and even if you could, the resultant dictionary would weigh 4 million pounds and have to be updated hourly.[20] The fact is that any lexicographer is going to have to make choices about what gets in and what doesn't. And these choices are based on ... what? And now we're right back where we started.\n\nIt is true that, as a SNOOT, I am probably neurologically predisposed to look for flaws in Gove et al.'s methodological argument. But these flaws seem awfully easy to find. Probably the biggest one is that the Descriptivists' \"scientific lexicography\" \u2014 under which, keep in mind, the ideal English dictionary is basically number-crunching; you somehow observe every linguistic act by every native/naturalized speaker of English and put the sum of all these acts between two covers and call it The Dictionary \u2014 involves an incredibly simplistic and outdated understanding of what \"scientific\" means. It requires a naive belief in scientific objectivity, for one thing. Even in the physical sciences, everything from quantum mechanics to Information Theory has shown that an act of observation is itself part of the phenomenon observed and is analytically inseparable from it.\n\nIf you remember your old college English classes, there's an analogy here that points up the trouble scholars get into when they confuse observation with interpretation. Recall the New Critics.[21] They believed that literary criticism was best conceived as a \"scientific\" endeavor: The critic was a neutral, careful, unbiased, highly trained observer whose job was to find and objectively describe meanings that were right there \u2014 literally inside \u2014 pieces of literature. Whether you know what happened to the New Criticism's reputation depends on whether you took college English after c. 1975; suffice it to say that its star bas dimmed. The New Critics had the same basic problem as Gove's Methodological Descriptivists: They believed that scientific meant the same thing as neutral or unbiased. And that linguistic meanings could exist \"objectively,\" separate from any interpretive act.\n\nThe point of the analogy is that claims to objectivity in language study are now the stuff of jokes and shudders. The epistemological assumptions that underlie Methodological Descriptivism have been thoroughly debunked and displaced \u2014 n Lit by the rise of post-structuralism, Reader-Response Criticism, and Jaussian Reception Theory; in linguistics by the rise of Pragmatics \u2014 and it's now pretty much universally accepted that (a) meaning is inseparable from some act of interpretation and (b) an act of interpretation is always somewhat biased, i.e., informed by the interpreter's particular ideology. And the consequence of (a) and (b) is that there's no way around it \u2014 decisions about what to put in The Dictionary and what to exclude are going to be based on a lexicographer's ideology. And every lexicographer's got one. To presume that dictionary-making can somehow avoid or transcend ideology is simply to subscribe to a particular ideology, one that might aptly be called Unbelievably Naive Positivism.\n\nThere's an even more important way Descriptivists are wrong in thinking that the Scientific Method is appropriate to the study of language:\n\nEven if, as a thought experiment, we assume a kind of nineteenth-century scientific realism-in which, even though some scientists' interpretations of natural phenomena might be biased[22] the natural phenomena themselves can be supposed to exist wholly independent of either observation or interpretation \u2014 no such realist supposition can be made about \"language behavior,\" because this behavior is both human and fundamentally normative. To understand this, you have only to accept the proposition that language is by its very nature public \u2014 i.e., that there can be no such thing as a Private Language[23] and then to observe the way Methodological Descriptivists seem either ignorant of this fact or oblivious to its consequences, as in for example one Charles Fries's introduction to an epigone of Webster's Third called The American College Dictionary:\n\nA dictionary can be an \"authority\" only in the\nsense in which a book of chemistry or of physics\nor of botany can be an \"authority\": by the accuracy\nand the completeness of its record of the observed\nfacts of the field examined, in accord with the latest\nprinciples and techniques of the particular science.\n\nThis is so stupid it practically drools. An \"authoritative\" physics text presents the results of physicists' observations and physicists' theories about those observations. If a physics textbook operated on Descriptivist principles, the fact that some Americans believe that electricity flows better downhill (based on the observed fact that power lines tend to run high above the homes they serve) would require the Electricity Flows Better Downhill Theory to be included as a \"valid\" theory in the textbook \u2014 just as, for Dr. Fries, if some Americans use infer for imply, the use becomes an ipso facto \"valid\" part of the language. Structural linguists like Gove and Fries are not, finally, scientists but census-takers who happen to misconstrue the importance of \"observed facts.\" It isn't scientific phenomena they're tabulating but rather a set of human behaviors, and a lot of human behaviors are \u2014 to be blunt \u2014 moronic. Try, for instance, to imagine an \"authoritative\" ethics textbook whose principles were based on what most people actually do.\n\nNorm-wise, let's keep in mind that language didn't come into being because our hairy ancestors were sitting around the veldt with nothing better to do. Language was invented to serve certain specific purposes:[24] \"That mushroom is poisonous\"; \"Knock these two rocks together and you can start a fire\"; \"This shelter is mine!\" And so on. Clearly, as linguistic communities evolve over time, they discover that some ways of using language are \"better\" than others \u2014 meaning better with respect to the community's purposes. If we assume that one such purpose might be communicating which kinds of food are safe to eat, then you can see how, for example, a misplaced modifier might violate an important norm:\n\n\"People who eat that kind of mushroom often get sick\" confuses the recipient about whether he'll get sick only if he eats the mushroom frequently or whether he stands a good chance of getting sick the very first time he eats it. In other words, the community has a vested practical interest in excluding this kind of misplaced modifier from acceptable usage; and even if a certain percentage of tribesmen screw up and use them, this still doesn't make m.m.'s a good idea.\n\nMaybe now the analogy between usage and ethics is clearer. Just because people sometimes lie, cheat on their taxes, or scream at their kids, this doesn't mean that they think those things are \"good.\" The whole point of norms is to help us evaluate our actions (including utterances) according to what we as a community have decided our real interests and purposes are. Granted, this analysis is oversimplified; in practice it's incredibly hard to arrive at norms and to keep them at least minimally fair or sometimes even to agree on what they are (q.v. today's Culture Wars). But the Descriptivists' assumption that all usage norms are arbitrary and dispensable leads to \u2014 well, have a mushroom.\n\nThe connotations of arbitrary here are tricky, though, and this sort of segues into the second argument Descriptivists make. There is a sense in which specific linguistic conventions are arbitrary. For instance, there's no particular metaphysical reason why our word for a four-legged mammal that gives milk and goes Moo is cow and not, say, prtlmpf. The uptown phrase for this is \"the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign,\" and it's used, along with certain principles of cognitive science and generative grammar, in a more philosophically sophisticated version of Descriptivism that holds the conventions of SWE to be more like the niceties of fashion than like actual norms. This \"Philosophical Descriptivism\" doesn't care much about dictionaries or method; its target is the standard SNOOT claim supra \u2014 that prescriptive rules have their ultimate justification in the community's need to make its language meaningful.\n\nThe argument goes like this. An English sentence's being meaningful is not the same as its being grammatical. That is, such clearly ill-formed constructions as \"Did you seen the car keys of me?\" or \"The show was looked by many people\" are nevertheless comprehensible; the sentences do, more or less, communicate the information they're trying to get across. Add to this the fact that nobody who isn't damaged in some profound Oliver Sacksish way actually ever makes these sorts of very deep syntactic errors[25] and you get the basic proposition of Noam Chomsky's generative linguistics, which is that there exists a Universal Grammar beneath and common to all languages, plus that there is probably an actual part of the human brain that's imprinted with this Universal Grammar the same way birds' brains are imprinted with Fly South and dogs' with Sniff Genitals. There's all kinds of compelling evidence and support for these ideas, not least of which are the advances that linguists and cognitive scientists and A.I. researchers have been able to make with them, and the theories have a lot of credibility, and they are adduced by the Philosophical Descriptivists to show that since the really important rules of language are at birth already hardwired into people's neocortex; SWE prescriptions against dangling participles or mixed metaphors are basically the linguistic equivalent of whalebone corsets and short forks for salad. As Descriptivist Steven Pinker puts it, \"When a scientist considers all the high-tech mental machinery needed to order words into everyday sentences, prescriptive rules are, at best, inconsequential decorations.\"\n\nThis argument is not the barrel of drugged trout that Methodological Descriptivism was, but it's still vulnerable to some objections. The first one is easy. Even if it's true that we're all wired with a Universal Grammar, it simply doesn't follow that all prescriptive rules are superfluous. Some of these rules really do seem to serve clarity, and precision. The injunction against twoway adverbs (\"People who eat this often get sick\") is an obvious example, as are rules about other kinds of misplaced modifiers (\"There are many reasons why lawyers lie, some better than others\") and about relative pronouns' proximity to the nouns they modify (\"She's the mother of an infant daughter who works twelve hours a day\").\n\nGranted the Philosophical Descriptivist can question just how absolutely necessary these rules are, it's quite likely that a recipient of clauses like the above could figure out what the sentences mean from the sentences on either side or from the \"overall context\" or whatever. A listener can usually figure out what I really mean when I misuse infer for imply or say indicate for say, too. But many of these solecisms require at least a couple extra nanoseconds of cognitive effort, a kind of rapid sift-and-discard process, before the recipient gets it. Extra work. It's debatable just how much extra work, but it seems indisputable that we put some extra neural burden on the recipient when we fail to follow certain conventions. W/r/t confusing clauses like the above, it simply seems more \"considerate\" to follow the rules of correct SWE ... just as it's more \"considerate\" to de-slob your home before entertaining guests or to brush your teeth before picking up a date. Not just more considerate but more respectful somehow \u2014 both of your listener and of what you're trying to get across. As we sometimes also say about elements of fashion and etiquette, the way you use English \"Makes a Statement\" or \"Sends a Message\" \u2014 even though these Statements/Messages often have nothing to do with the actual information you're trying to transmit.\n\nWe've now sort of bled into a more serious rejoinder to Philosophical Descriptivism: From the fact that linguistic communication is not strictly dependent on usage and grammar it does not necessarily follow that the traditional rules of usage and grammar are nothing but \"inconsequential decorations.\" Another way to state the objection is that just because something is \"decorative\" does not necessarily make it \"inconsequential.\" Rhetorically, Pinker's flip dismissal is bad tactics, for it invites the very question it begs: inconsequential to whom?\n\nTake, for example, the Descriptivism claim that so-called correct English usages such as brought rather than brung and felt rather than feeled are arbitrary and restrictive and unfair and are supported only by custom and are (like irregular verbs in general) archaic and incommodious and an all-around pain in the ass. Let us concede for the moment that these objections are 100 percent reasonable. Then let's talk about pants. Trousers, slacks. I suggest to you that having the \"correct\" subthoracic clothing for U.S. males be pants instead of skirts is arbitrary (lots of other cultures let men wear skirts), restrictive and unfair (U.S. females get to wear pants), based solely on archaic custom (I think it's got something to do with certain traditions about gender and leg position, the same reasons girls' bikes don't have a crossbar), and in certain ways not only incommodious but illogical (skirts are more comfortable than pants; pants ride up; pants are hot; pants can squish the genitals and reduce fertility; over time pants chafe and erode irregular sections of men's leg hair and give older men hideous half-denuded legs, etc. etc.). Let us grant \u2014 as a thought experiment if nothing else \u2014 that these are all reasonable and compelling objections to pants as an androsartorial norm. Let us in fact in our minds and hearts say yes \u2014 shout yes \u2014 to the skirt, the kilt, the toga, the sarong, the jupe. Let us dream of or even in our spare time work toward an America where nobody lays any arbitrary sumptuary prescriptions on anyone else and we can all go around as comfortable and aerated and unchafed and unsquished and motile as we want.\n\nAnd yet the fact remains that, in the broad cultural mainstream of millennial America, men do not wear skirts. If you, the reader, are a U.S. male, and even if you share my personal objections to pants and dream as I do of a cool and genitally unsquishy American Tomorrow, the odds are still 99.9 percent that in 100 percent of public situations you wear pants/slacks/shorts/trunks. More to the point, if you are a U.S. male and also have a U.S. male child, and if that child were to come to you one evening and announce his desire/intention to wear a skirt rather than pants to school the next day, I am 100-percent confident that you are going to discourage him from doing so. Strongly discourage him. You could be a Molotov-tossing anti-pants radical or a kilt manufacturer or Steven Pinker himself \u2014 you're going to stand over your kid and be prescriptive about an arbitrary, archaic, uncomfortable, and inconsequentially decorative piece of clothing. Why? Well, because in modern America any little boy who comes to school in a skirt (even, say, a modest all-season midi) is going to get stared at and shunned and beaten up and called a Total Geekoid by a whole lot of people whose approval and acceptance are important to him.[26] In our culture, in other words, a boy who wears a skirt is Making a Statement that is going to have all kinds of gruesome social and emotional consequences.\n\nYou see where this is going. I'm going to describe the intended point of the pants analogy in terms I'm sure are simplistic \u2014 doubtless there are whole books in Pragmatics or psycholinguistics or something devoted to unpacking this point. The weird thing is that I've seen neither Descriptivists nor SNOTs deploy it in the Wars.[27]\n\nWhen I say or write something, there are actually a whole lot of different things I am communicating. The propositional content (the actual information I'm trying to convey) is only one part of it. Another part is stuff about me, the communicator. Everyone knows this. It's a function of the fact that there are uncountably many well-formed ways to say the same basic thing, from e.g. \"I was attacked by a bear!\" to \"Goddamn bear tried to kill me!\" to \"That ursine juggernaut bethought to sup upon my person!\" and so on. And different levels of diction and formality are only the simplest kinds of distinction; things get way more complicated in the sorts of interpersonal communication where social relations and feelings and moods come into play. Here's a familiar sort of example. Suppose that you and I are acquaintances and we're in my apartment having a conversation and that at some point I want to terminate the conversation and not have you be in my apartment anymore. Very delicate social moment. Think of all the different ways I can try to handle it: \"Wow, look at the time\"; \"Could we finish this up later?\"; \"Could you please leave now?\"; \"Go\"; \"Get out\"; \"Get the hell out of here\"; \"Didn't you say you had to be someplace?\"; \"Time for you to hit the dusty trail, my friend\"; \"Off you go then, love\"; or that sly old telephone-conversation ender: \"Well, I'm going to let you go now\"; etc. And then think of all the different factors and implications of each option.\n\nThe point here is obvious. It concerns a phenomenon that SNOOTS blindly reinforce and that Descriptivists badly underestimate and that scary vocab-tape ads try to exploit. People really do \"judge\" one another according to their use of language. Constantly. Of course, people judge one another on the basis of all kinds of things \u2014 weight, scent, physiognomy, occupation, make of vehicle[28] \u2014 and, again, doubtless it's all terribly complicated and occupies whole battalions of sociolinguists. But it's clear that at least one component of all this interpersonal semantic judging involves acceptance, meaning not some touchy-feely emotional affirmation but actual acceptance or rejection of somebody's bid to be regarded as a peer, a member of somebody else's collective or community or Group. Another way to come at this is to acknowledge something that in the Usage Wars gets mentioned only in very abstract terms: \"Correct\" English usage is, as a practical matter, a function of whom you're talking to and how you want that person to respond \u2014 not just to your utterance but also to you. In other words, a large part of the agenda of any communication is rhetorical and depends on what some rhet-scholars call \"Audience\" or \"Discourse Community.\"[29] And the United States obviously has a huge number of such Discourse Communities, many of them regional and/or cultural dialects of English: Black English, Latino English, Rural Southern, Urban Southern, Standard Upper-Midwest, Maine Yankee, East-Texas Bayou, Boston BlueCollar, on and on. Everybody knows this. What not everyone knows \u2014 especially not certain Prescriptivists \u2014 is that many of these non-SWE dialects have their own highly developed and internally consistent grammars, and that some of these dialects' usage norms actually make more linguistic/aesthetic sense than do their Standard counterparts (see INTERPOLATION). Plus, of course, there are innumerable sub- and subsubdialects based on all sorts of things that have nothing to do with locale or ethnicity \u2014 Medical-School English, Peorians-Who-Follow-Pro-Wrestling-Closely English, Twelve-Year-Old-Males-Whose-Worldview-Is-Deeply-Informed-By-South-Park English \u2014 and that are nearly incomprehensible to anyone who isn't inside their very tight and specific Discourse Community (which of course is part of their function[30]).\n\nINTERPOLATION: EXAMPLE OF GRAMMATICAL ADVANTAGES OF A NON-STANDARD DIALECT THAT THIS REVIEWER ACTUALLY KNOWS ABOUT FIRSTHAND\n\nThis rev. happens to have two native English dialects \u2014 the SWE of my hypereducated parents and the hard-earned Rural Midwestern of most of my peers. When I'm talking to R.M.'s, I usually use, for example, the construction \"Where's it at?\" instead of \"Where is it?\" Part of this is a naked desire to fit in and not get rejected as an egghead or fag (see sub). But another part is that I, SNOOT or no, believe that this and other R.M.isms are in certain ways superior to their Standard equivalents.\n\nFor a dogmatic Prescriptivist, \"Where's it at?\" is double-damned as a sentence that not only ends with a preposition but whose final preposition forms a redundancy with where that's similar to the redundancy in \"the reason is because\" (which latter usage I'll admit makes me dig my nails into my palms). Rejoinder: First off, the avoid-terminal-prepositions rule is the invention of one Fr. R. Lowth, an eighteenth-century British preacher and indurate pedant who did things like spend scores of pages arguing for hath over the trendy and degenerate has. The a.-t.-p. rule is antiquated and stupid and only the most ayatolloid SNOOT takes it seriously. Garner himself calls the rule \"stuffy\" and lists all kinds of useful constructions like \"the man you were listening to\" that we'd have to discard or distort if we really enforced it.\n\nPlus the apparent redundancy of \"Where's it at?\" [31] is offset by its metrical logic. What the at really does is license the contraction of is after the interrogative adverb. You can't say \"Where's it?\" So the choice is between \"Where is it?\" and \"Where's it at?\", and the latter, a strong anapest, is prettier and trips off the tongue better than \"Where is it?\", whose meter is either a clunky monosyllabic foot + trochee or it's nothing at all.\n\nThis is probably the place for your SNOOT reviewer openly to concede that a certain number of traditional prescriptive rules really are stupid and that people who insist on them (like the legendary assistant to PM. Margaret Thatcher who refused to read any memo with a split infinitive in it, or the jr.-high teacher I had who automatically graded you down if you started a sentence with Hopefully) are that very most pathetic and dangerous sort of SNOOT, the SNOOT Who Is Wrong. The injunction against split infinitives, for instance, is a consequence of the weird fact that English grammar is modeled on Latin even though Latin is a synthetic language and English is an analytic language. [32] Latin infinitives consist of one word and are impossible to as it were split, and the earliest English Prescriptivists \u2014 so enthralled with Latin that their English usage guides were actually written in Latin [33] \u2014 decided that English infinitives shouldn't be split either. Garner himself takes out after the s.i. rule in both SPLIT INFINITIVES and SUPERSTITIONS. [34] And Hopefully at the beginning of a sentence, as a certain cheeky eighth-grader once pointed out to his everlasting social cost, actually functions not as a misplaced modal auxiliary or as a manner adverb like quickly or angrily but as a \"sentence adverb\" that indicates the speaker's attitude about the state of affairs described by the sentence (examples of perfectly OK sentence adverbs are Clearly, Basically, Luckily), and only SNOOTs educated in the high-pedantic years up to 1960 blindly proscribe it or grade it down.\n\nThe cases of split infinitives and Hopefully are in fact often trotted out by dogmatic Descriptivists as evidence that all SWE usage rules are arbitrary and stupid (which is a bit like pointing to Pat Buchanan as evidence that all Republicans are maniacs). Garner rejects Hopefully's knee-jerk proscription, too, albeit grudgingly, including the adverb in his miniessay on SKUNKED TERMS, which is his phrase for a usage that is \"hotly disputed.., any use of it is likely to distract some readers.\" (Garner also points out something I'd never quite realized, which is that hopefully, if misplaced/mispunctuated in the body of a sentence, can create some of the same two-way ambiguities as other adverbs, as in the clause \"I will borrow your book and hopefully read it soon.\")\n\nWhether we're conscious of it or or, most of us are fluent in more than one major English dialect and in a large number of subdialects and are probably at least passable in countless others. Which dialect you choose to use depends, of course, on whom you're addressing. More to the point, I submit that the dialect you use depends mostly on what sort of Group your listener is part of and whether you wish to present yourself as a fellow member of that Group. An obvious example is that traditional upper-class English has certain dialectal differences from lower-class English and that schools used to have courses in Elocution whose whole point was to teach people how to speak in an upper-class way. But usage-as-inclusion is about much more than class. Here's another thought experiment: A bunch of U.S. teenagers in clothes that look far too large for them are sitting together in the local mall's Food Court, and a 53-year-old man with a combover and clothes that fit comes over to them and says that he was scoping them and thinks they're totally rad and/or phat and is it cool if he just kicks it and does the hang here with them. The kids' reaction is going to be either scorn or embarrassment for the guy \u2014 most likely a mix of both. Q: Why? Or imagine that two hard-core urban black guys are standing there talking and I, who am resoundingly and in all ways white, come up and greet them with \"Yo\" and call them \"Brothers\" and ask \"s'up, s'goin on,\" pronouncing on with that NYCish oo-o diphthong that Young Urban Black English deploys for a standard o. Either these guys are going to be offended or they are going to think I am simply out of my mind. No other reaction is remotely foreseeable. Q: Why?\n\nWhy: A dialect of English is learned and used either because it's your native vernacular or because it's the dialect of a Group by which you wish (with some degree of plausibility) to be accepted. And although it is the major and arguably the most important one, SWE is only one dialect. And it is never, or at least hardly ever, anybody's only dialect. This is because there are \u2014 as you and I both know and yet no one in the Usage Wars ever seems to mention \u2014 situations in which faultlessly correct SWE is clearly not the appropriate dialect.\n\nChildhood is full of such situations. This is one reason why SNOOTlets tend to have a very hard social time of it in school. A SNOOTlet is a little kid who's wildly, precociously fluent in SWE (he is often, recall, the offspring of SNOOTs). Just about every class has a SNOOTlet, so I know you've seen them \u2014 these are the sorts of six- to twelve-year-olds who use whom correctly and whose response to striking out in T-ball is to cry out \"How incalculably dreadful!\" etc. The elementary-school SNOOTlet is one of the earliest identifiable species of academic Geekoid and is duly despised by his peers and praised by his teachers. These teachers usually don't see the incredible amounts of punishment the SNOOTlet is receiving from his classmates, or if they do see it they blame the classmates and shake their heads sadly at the vicious and arbitrary cruelty of which children are capable.\n\nBut the other children's punishment of the SNOOTIet is not arbitrary at all. There are important things at stake. Little kids in school are learning about Group-inclusion and -exclusion and about the respective rewards and penalties of same and about the use of dialect and syntax and slang as signals of affinity and inclusion. [35] They're learning about Discourse Communities. Kids learn this stuff not in English or Social Studies but on the playground and at lunch and on the bus. When his peers are giving the SNOOTlet monstrous quadruple Wedgies or holding him down and taking turns spitting on him, there's serious learning going on ... for everyone except the little SNOOT, who in fact is being punished for precisely his failure to learn. What neither he nor his teacher realizes is that the SNOOTlet is deficient in Language Arts. He has only one dialect. He cannot alter his vocabulary, usage, or grammar, cannot use slang or vulgarity; and it's these abilities that are really required for \"peer rapport,\" which is just a fancy Elementary-Ed term for being accepted by the most important Group in the little kid's life.\n\nThis reviewer acknowledges that there seems to be some, umm, personal stuff getting dredged up and worked out here;[36] but the stuff is relevant. The point is that the little A+ SNOOTlet is actually in the same dialectal position as the class's \"slow\" kid who can't learn to stop using ain't or bringed. One is punished in class, the other on the playground, but both are deficient in the same linguistic skill \u2014 viz., the ability to move between various dialects and levels of \"correctness,\" the ability to communicate one way with peers and another way with teachers and another with family and another with Little League coaches and so on. Most of these dialectal adjustments are made below the level of conscious awareness, and our ability to make them seems part psychological and part something else \u2014 perhaps something hardwired into the same motherboard as Universal Grammar \u2014 and in truth this ability is a far better indicator of a kid's \"Verbal I.Q.\" than test scores or grades, since U.S. English classes do far more to retard dialectal talent than to cultivate it.\n\nWell-known fact: In neither K-12 or college English are systematic WE grammar and usage much taught anymore. It's been this way for more than 20 years. The phenomenon drives Prescriptivists nuts, and it's one of the big things they cite as evidence of America's gradual murder of English. Descriptivists and English-Ed specialists counter that grammar and usage have been abandoned because scientific research proved that studying SWE grammar and usage simply doesn't help make kids better writers. Each side in the debate tends to regard the other as mentally ill or/and blinded by political ideology. Neither camp appears ever to have considered whether maybe the way prescriptive SWE was traditionally taught had something to do with its inutility.\n\nBy way here I'm referring not so much to actual method as to spirit or attitude. Most traditional teachers of English grammar have, of course, been dogmatic SNOOTs, and like most dogmatists they've been incredibly stupid about the rhetoric they used and the Audience they were addressing. [37] I refer specifically to their assumption that SWE is the sole appropriate English dialect and that the only reasons anyone could fail to see this are ignorance or amentia or grave deficiencies in character. As rhetoric, this sort of attitude works only in sermons to the Choir, and as pedagogy it's just disastrous. The reality is that an average U.S. student is going to go to the trouble of mastering the difficult conventions of SWE only if he sees SWE's relevant Group or Discourse Community as one he'd like to be part of. And in the absence of any sort of argument for why the correct-SWE Group is a good or desirable one (an argument that, recall, the traditional teacher hasn't given, because he's such a dogmatic SNOOT he sees no need to), the student is going to be reduced to evaluating the desirability of the SWE Group based on the one obvious member of the Group he's encountered, namely the SNOOTy teacher himself.\n\nI'm not suggesting here that an effective SWE pedagogy would require teachers to wear sunglasses and call students \"Dude.\" What I am suggesting is that the rhetorical situation of an English class \u2014 a class composed wholly of young people whose Group identity is rooted in defiance of Adult-Establishment values, plus also composed partly of minorities whose primary dialects are different from SWE \u2014 requires the teacher to come up with overt, honest, compelling arguments for why SWE is a dialect worth learning.\n\nThese arguments are hard to make \u2014 not intellectually but emotionally, politically. Because they are baldly elitist. [38] The real truth, of course, is that SWE is the dialect of the American elite. That it was invented, codified, and promulgated by Privileged WASP Males and is perpetuated as \"Standard\" by same. That it is the shibboleth of the Establishment and an instrument of political power and class division and racial discrimination and all manner of social inequity. These are shall we say rather delicate subjects to bring up in an English class, especially in the service of a pro-SWE argument, and extra-especially if you yourself are both a Privileged WASP Male and the Teacher and thus pretty much a walking symbol of the Adult Establishment. This reviewer's opinion, though, is that both students and SWE are better served if the teacher makes his premises explicit, licit and his argument overt, presenting himself as an advocate of SWE's utility rather than as a prophet of its innate superiority.\n\nBecause this argument is both most delicate and (I believe) most important with respect to students of color, here is one version of a spiel I've given in private conference [39] with certain black students who were (a) bright and inquisitive and (b) deficient in what U.S. higher education considers written English facility:\n\nI don't know whether anybody's told you this or not,\nbut when you're in a college English class you're basically\nstudying a foreign dialect. This dialect is called 'Standard\nWritten English. ... From talking with you and reading\nyour essays, I've concluded that your own primary dialect\nis [one of three variants of SBE common to our region]. Now,\nlet me spell something out in my official Teacher-voice:\nThe SBE you're fluent in is different from SWE in all kinds\nof important ways. Some of these differences are\ngrammatical \u2014 for example, double negatives are OK\nin Standard Black English but not in SWE, and SBE\nand SWE conjugate certain verbs in totally different\nways. Other differences have more to do with style \u2014\nfor instance, Standard Written English tends to use a lot\nmore subordinate clauses in the early parts of sentences,\nand it sets off most of these early subordinates with commas,\nand, under SWE rules, writing that doesn't do this is \"choppy.\"\nThere are tons of differences like that. How much of this\nstuff do you already know?\n[STANDARD RESPONSE: some variation on \"I know from\nthe grades and comments on my papers that English profs\ndon't think I'm a good writer.\"]\nWell, I've got good news and bad news. There are some\notherwise smart English profs who aren't very aware that\nthere are real dialects of English other than SWE, so when\nthey're reading your papers they'll put, like, \"Incorrect\nconjugation\" or \"Comma needed\" instead of \"SWE\nconjugates this verb differently\" or \"SWE calls for a comma\nhere.\" That's the good news \u2014 it's not that you're a\nbad writer, it's that you haven't learned the special\nrules of the dialect they want you to write in. Maybe\nthat's not such good news, that they were grading you\ndown for mistakes in a foreign language you didn't even\nknow was a foreign language. That they won't let you write\nin SBE. Maybe it seems unfair. If it does, you're not going\nto like this news: I'm not going to let you write in SBE\neither. In my class, you have to learn and write in SWE.\nIf you want to study your own dialect and its rules and history\nand how it's different from SWE, fine \u2014 there are some\ngreat books by scholars of Black English, and I'll help you\nfind some and talk about them with you if you want. But\nthat will be outside class. In class \u2014 in my English class \u2014\nyou will have to master and write in Standard Written English,\nwhich we might just as well call \"Standard White English,\"\nbecause it was developed by white people and is used\nby white people, especially educated, powerful white people.\n[RESPONSES by this point vary too widely to standardize.]\nI'm respecting you enough here to give you what I believe is\nthe straight truth. In this country, SWE is perceived as the\ndialect of education and intelligence and power and prestige,\nand anybody of any race, ethnicity, religion, or gender\nwho wants to succeed in American culture has got to be able\nto use SWE. This is How It Is. You can be glad about it or sad\nabout it or deeply pissed off. You can believe it's racist and\nunjust and decide right here and now to spend every waking\nminute of your adult life arguing against it, and maybe you\nshould, but I'll tell you something: If you ever want those\narguments to get listened to and taken seriously, you're\ngoing to have to communicate them in SWE, because SWE is\nthe dialect our country uses to talk to itself. African\nAmericans who've become successful and important in\nU.S. culture know this; that's why King's and X's and\nJackson's speeches are in SWE, and why Morrison's and\nAngelou's and Baldwin's and Wideman's and West's books\nare full of totally ass-kicking SWE, and why black judges\nand politicians and journalists and doctors and teachers\ncommunicate professionally in SWE. Some of these people\ngrew up in homes and communities where SWE was the\nnative dialect, and these black people had it much easier\nin school, but the ones who didn't grow up with SWE\nrealized at some point that they had to learn it and\nbecome able to write in it, and so they did. And [INSERT\nNAME HERE], you're going to learn to use it, too, because\nI am going to make you.\n\nI should note here that a couple of the students I've said this stuff to were offended \u2014 one lodged an Official Complaint \u2014 and that I have had more than one colleague profess to find my spiel \"racially insensitive.\" Perhaps you do, too. My own humble opinion is that some of the cultural and political realities of American life are themselves racially insensitive and elitist and offensive and unfair, and that pussyfooting around these realities with euphemistic doublespeak is not only hypocritical but toxic to the project of ever actually changing them. Such pussyfooting has of course now achieved the status of a dialect \u2014 one powerful enough to have turned the normal politics of the Usage Wars sort of inside out.\n\nI refer here to Politically Correct English (PCE), under whose conventions failing students become \"high-potential\" students and poor people \"economically disadvantaged\" and people in wheelchairs \"differently abled\" and a sentence like \"White English and Black English are different and you better learn White English if you don't want to flunk\" is not blunt but \"insensitive.\" Although it's common to make jokes about PCE (referring to ugly people as \"aesthetically challenged\" and so on), be advised that Politically Correct English's various pre- and proscriptions are taken very seriously indeed by colleges and corporations and government agencies, whose own institutional dialects now evolve under the beady scrutiny of a whole new kind of Language Police.\n\nFrom one perspective, the history of PCE evinces a kind of Lenin-to-Stalinesque irony. That is, the same ideological principles that informed the original Descriptivist revolution \u2014 namely, the sixties-era rejections of traditional authority and traditional inequality \u2014 have now actually produced a far more inflexible Prescriptivism, one unencumbered by tradition or complexity and backed by the threat of real-world sanctions (termination, litigation) for those who fail to conform. This is sort of funny in a dark way, maybe, and most criticism of PCE seems to consist in making fun of its trendiness or vapidity. This reviewer's own opinion is that prescriptive PCE is not just silly but confused and dangerous.\n\nUsage is always political, of course, but it's complexly political. With respect, for instance, to political change, usage conventions can function in two ways: On the one hand they can be a reflection of political change, and on the other they can be an instrument of political change. These two functions are different and have to be kept straight. Confusing them \u2014 in particular, mistaking for political efficacy what is really just a language's political symbolism ... \u2014 enables the bizarre conviction that America ceases to be elitist or unfair simply because Americans stop using certain vocabulary that is historically associated with elitism and unfairness. This is PCE's central fallacy \u2014 that a society's mode of expression is productive of its attitudes rather than a product of those attitudes \u2014 and of course it's nothing but the obverse of the politically conservative SNOOT'S delusion that social change can be retarded by restricting change in standard usage. [40]\n\nForget Stalinization or Logic 101-level equivocations, though. There's a grosser irony about Politically Correct English. This is that PCE purports to be the dialect of progressive reform but is in fact \u2014 in its Orwellian substitution of the euphemisms of social equality for social equality itself \u2014 of vastly more help to conservatives and the U.S. status quo than traditional SNOOT prescriptions ever were. Were I, for instance, a political conservative who opposed taxation as a means of redistributing national wealth, I would be delighted to watch PCE progressives spend their time and energy arguing over whether a poor person should be described as \"low-income\" or \"economically disadvantaged\" or \"pre-prosperous\" rather than constructing effective public arguments for redistributive legislation or higher marginal tax rates on corporations. (Not to mention that strict codes of egalitarian euphemism serve to burke the sorts of painful, unpretty, and sometimes offensive discourse that in a pluralistic democracy leads to actual political change rather than symbolic political change. In other words, PCE functions as a form of censorship, and censorship always serves the status quo.)\n\nAs a practical matter, I strongly doubt whether a guy who has four small kids and makes $12,000 a year feels more empowered or less ill-used by a society that carefully refers to him as \"economically disadvantaged\" rather than \"poor.\" Were I he, in fact, I'd probably find the PCE term insulting \u2014 not just because it's patronizing but because it's hypocritical and self-serving. Like many forms of Vogue Usage,[41] PCE functions primarily to signal and congratulate certain virtues in the speaker \u2014 scrupulous egalitarianism, concern for the dignity of all people, sophistication about the political implications of language \u2014 and so serves the selfish interests of the PC far more than it serves any of the persons or groups renamed.\n\nINTERPOLATION ON A RELATED ISSUE IN THE FACE OF WHOSE GHASTLY MALIGNANCY THIS REVIEWER'S DEMOCRATIC SPIRIT JUST GIVES OUT ALTOGETHER, ADMITTEDLY\n\nThis issue is Academic English, a cancer that has metastasized now to afflict both scholarly writing \u2014\n\nIf such a sublime cyborg would insinuate the\nfuture as post-Fordist subject, his palpably\nmasochistic locations as ecstatic agent of the\nsublime superstate need to be decoded as\nthe \"now all-but-unreadable DNA\" of the fast\nindustrializing Detroit, just as his Robocop-like\nstrategy of carceral negotiation and street\ncontrol remains the tirelessly American one\nof inflicting regeneration through violence\nupon the racially heteroglassic wilds and others\nof the inner city.[42]\n\n\u2014 and prose as mainstream as The Village Voice's:\n\nAt first encounter, the poems' distanced\ncerebral surfaces can be daunting, evading\nphysical location or straightforward emotional\narc. But this seeming remoteness quickly\nreveals a very real passion, centered in the\nspeaker's struggle to define his evolving\nself-construction.\n\nMaybe it's a combination of my SNOOTitude and the fact that I end up having to read a lot of it for my job, but I'm afraid I regard Academic English not as a dialectal variation but as a grotesque debasement of SWE, and loathe it even more than the stilted incoherences of Presidential English (\"This is the best and only way to uncover, destroy, and prevent Iraq from reengineering weapons of mass destruction\") or the mangled pieties of BusinessSpeak (\"Our Mission: to proactively search and provide the optimum networking skills and resources to meet the needs of your growing business\"); and in support of this utter contempt and intolerance I cite no less an authority than Mr. G. Orwell, who 50 years ago had AE pegged as a \"mixture of vagueness and sheer incompetence\" in which \"it is normal to come across long passages which are almost completely lacking in meaning.\"[43]\n\nIt probably isn't the whole explanation, but, as with the voguish hypocrisy of PCE, the obscurity and pretension of Academic English can be attributed in part to a disruption in the delicate rhetorical balance between language as a vector of meaning and language as a vector of the writer's own resume. In other words, it is when a scholar's vanity/insecurity leads him to write primarily to communicate and reinforce his own status as an Intellectual that his English is deformed by pleonasm and pretentious diction (whose function is to signal the writer's erudition) and by opaque abstraction (whose function is to keep anybody from pinning the writer down to a definite assertion that can maybe be refuted or shown to be silly). The latter characteristic, a level of obscurity that often makes it just about impossible to figure out what an AE sentence is really saying, so closely resembles political and corporate doublespeak (\"revenue enhancement,\" \"downsizing,\" pre-owned,\" \"proactive resource-allocation restructuring\") that it's tempting to think AE's real purpose is concealment and its real motivation fear.\n\nThe insecurity that drives AE, PCE, and vocab-tape ads is far from groundless, though. These are tense linguistic times. Blame it on Heisenbergian Uncertainty or postmodern relativism or Image Over Substance or the ubiquity of advertising and P.R. or the rise of Identity Politics or whatever you will \u2014 we live in an era of terrible preoccupation with presentation and interpretation. In rhetorical terms, certain long-held distinctions between the Ethical Appeal, Logical Appeal (= an argument's plausibility or soundness), and Pathetic Appeal (= an argument's emotional impact) have now pretty much collapsed \u2014 or rather the different sorts of Appeals now affect and are affected by one another in ways that make it almost impossible to advance an argument on \"reason\" alone.\n\nA vividly concrete illustration here concerns the Official Complaint a black undergraduate filed against this rev. after one of my little in camera spiels described on pages 53-54. The complainant was (I opine) wrong, but she was not crazy or stupid; and I was able later to see that I did bear some responsibility for the whole nasty administrative swivet. My culpability lay in gross rhetorical naivete. I'd seen my speech's primary Appeal as Logical: The aim was to make a conspicuously blunt, honest argument for SWE's utility. It wasn't pretty, maybe, but it was true, plus so manifestly bullshit-free that I think I anticipated not just acquiescence but gratitude for my candor. [44] The problem I failed to see, of course, lay not with the argument per se but with the person making it \u2014 namely me, a Privileged WASP Male in a position of power, thus someone whose statements about the primacy and utility of the Privileged WASP Male dialect appeared not candid/hortatory/ authoritative/true but elitist/high-handed/ authoritarian/racist. Rhetoric-wise what happened was that I allowed the substance and style of my Logical Appeal to completely torpedo my Ethical Appeal: What the student heard was just another PWM rationalizing why his Group and his English were top dog and ought \"logically\" to stay that way (plus, worse, trying to use his academic power over her to coerce her assent [45] ).\n\nIf for any reason you happen to find yourself sharing this particular student's perceptions and reaction, [46] I would ask that you bracket your feelings long enough to recognize that the PWM instructor's very modern rhetorical dilemma in that office was really no different from the dilemma faced by a male who makes a Pro-Life argument, or an atheist who argues against Creation Science, or a Caucasian who opposes Affirmative Action, or an African American who decries Racial Profiling, or anyone over eighteen who tries to make a case for raising the legal driving age to eighteen, etc. The dilemma has nothing to do with whether the arguments themselves are plausible or right or even sane, because the debate rarely gets that far \u2014 any opponent with sufficiently strong feelings or a dogmatic bent can discredit the arguments and pretty much foreclose all further discussion with a single, terribly familiar rejoinder: \"Of course you'd say that\"; \"Easy for you to say\"; \"What right do you have ...?\"\n\nNow (still bracketing) consider the situation of any reasonably intelligent and well-meaning SNOOT who sits down to prepare a prescriptive usage guide. It's the millennium, post-Everything: Whence the authority to make any sort of credible Appeal for SWE at all?\n\nARTICLE'S CRUX: WHY BRYAN A. GARNER IS A GENIUS, THOUGH OF A RATHER PARTICULAR KIND\n\nIt isn't that A Dictionary of Modern American Usage is perfect It doesn't seem to cover conversant in vs. conversant with, for example, or abstruse vs. obtuse, or to have anything on hereby and herewith (which I tend to use interchangeably but always have the uneasy feeling I'm screwing up). Garner's got a good discussion of used to but nothing on supposed to. Nor does he give any examples to help explain irregular participles and transitivity (\"The light shone\" vs. \"I shined the light,\" etc.), and these would seem to be more important than, say, the correct spelling of huzzah or the plural of animalculum, both of which get discussed. Plus there's the VOGUE WORDS snafu and the absence of a pronunciation entry on trough. [47] In other words, a SNOOT is going to be able to find stuff to quibble about in any usage dictionary, and ADMAU is no exception.\n\nBut it's still really, really good \u2014 and not just lexicographically but rhetorically, politically (if it even makes sense to distinguish these any more). As a collection of judgments, ADMAU is in no way Descriptivist, but Garner structures his judgments very carefully to avoid the elitism and anality of traditional SNOGTitude. He does not deploy irony or scorn or caustic wit, nor tropes or colloquialisms or contractions ... or really any sort of verbal style at all. In fact, even though Garner talks openly about himself and uses the 1-S pronoun throughout the whole dictionary, his personality is oddly effaced, neutralized. It's like he's so bland he's barely there. E.g., as this reviewer was finishing the book's final entry,[48] it struck me that I had no idea whether Bryan Garner was black or white, gay or straight, Democrat or Dittohead. What was even more striking was that I hadn't once wondered about any of this up to now; something about Garner's lexical persona kept me ever from asking where the guy was coming from or what particular agendas or ideologies were informing what he had admitted right up front were \"value judgments.\"\n\nBryan Garner is a genius because the Dictionary of Modern American Usage pretty much resolves the Usage Wars' Crisis of Authority. Garner manages to control the compresence of rhetorical Appeals so cleverly that he appears able to transcend both Usage Wars camps and simply tell the truth, and in a way that does not torpedo his own credibility but actually enhances it. His argumentative strategy is totally brilliant and totally sneaky, and part of both qualities is that it usually doesn't seem like there's even an argument going on at all.\n\nGarner recognizes something that neither of the dogmatic camps appears to get: Given 40 years of the Usage Wars, \"authority\" is no longer something a lexicographer can just presume ex officio. In fact, a large part of the project of any contemporary usage dictionary will consist in establishing this authority. If that seems rather obvious, be apprised that nobody before Garner seems to have figured it out \u2014 that the lexicographer's challenge now is to be not just accurate and comprehensive but credible. That in the absence of unquestioned Authority in language, the reader must now be moved or persuaded to grant a dictionary its authority, freely and for what appear to be good reasons.\n\nGarner's A Dictionary of Modern American Usage is thus both a collection of information and a piece of Democratic rhetoric.[49] Its goal is to recast the Prescriptivist's persona: The author presents himself as an authority not in an autocratic sense but in a technocratic sense. And the technocrat is not only a thoroughly modern and palatable image of Authority but also immune to the charges of elitism/classism that have hobbled traditional Prescriptivism.\n\nOf course, Garner really is a technocrat. He's a lawyer, recall, and in ADMAU he consciously projects a sort of wise juridical persona: knowledgeable, dispassionate, fair, with an almost Enlightenment-grade passion for reason. His judgments about usage tend to be rendered like legal opinions \u2014 exhaustive citation of precedent (other dictionaries' judgments, published examples of actual usage) combined with clear, logical reasoning that's always informed by the larger consensual purposes SWE is meant to serve.\n\nAlso thoroughgoingly technocratic is Garner's approach to the issue of whether anybody's even going to be interested in his 700 pages of fine-pointed counsel. Like any specialist, he simply presumes that there are practical reasons why some people choose to concern themselves with SWE usage; and his attitude about the fact that most Americans \"could care less\" isn't scorn or disapproval but the phlegmatic resignation of a doctor or lawyer who realizes that he can give good advice but can't make you take it:\n\nThe reality I care about most is that some people\nstill want to use the language well.[50] They\nwant to write effectively; they want to speak effectively.\nThey want their language to be graceful at times and\npowerful at times. They want to understand how to\nuse words well, how to manipulate sentences, and how\nto move about in the language without seeming to flail.\nThey want good grammar, but they want more: they\nwant rhetoric[51] in the traditional sense.\nThat is, they want to use the language deftly so that\nit's fit for their purposes.\n\nIt's now possible to see that all the autobiographical stuff in ADMAU's Preface does more than just humanize Mr. Bryan A. Garner. It also serves to detail the early and enduring passion that helps make someone a credible technocrat \u2014 we tend to like and trust experts whose expertise is born of a real love for their specialty instead of just a desire to be expert at something. In fact, it turns out that ADMAU's Preface quietly and steadily invests Garner with every single qualification of modern technocratic Authority: passionate devotion, reason, and accountability (recall \"in the interests of full disclosure, here are the ten critical points ...\"), experience (\"that, after years of working on usage problems, I've settled on\"), exhaustive and tech-savvy research (\"For contemporary usage, the files of our greatest dictionary makers pale in comparison with the fulltext search capabilities now provided by NEXIS and WESTLAW\"), an even and judicious temperament (see e.g. this from HYPERCORRECTION: \"Sometimes people strive to abide by the strictest etiquette, but in the process behave inappropriately\" [52] ), and the sort of humble integrity (for instance, including in one of the entries a past published usage-error of his own) that not only renders Garner likable but transmits the same kind of reverence for English that good jurists have for the law, both of which are bigger and more important than any one person.\n\nProbably the most attractive thing about ADMAU's Ethical Appeal, though, is Garner's scrupulous consideration of the reader's concern about his (or her) own linguistic authority and rhetorical persona and ability to convince an Audience that he cares. Again and again, Garner frames his prescriptions in rhetorical terms, e.g.: \"To the writer or speaker for whom credibility is important, it's a good idea to avoid distracting any readers or listeners.\" Dictionary of Modern American Usage's real thesis, in other words, is that the purposes of the expert authority and the purposes of the lay reader are identical, and identically rhetorical \u2014 which I submit is about as Democratic these days as you're going to get.\n\nNOTES\n\n1. With the advent of online databases, Garner has access to far more examples of actual usage than did Gilman, and he deploys them to great effect. (FYI, Oxford's 1996 New Fowler's Modern English Usage is also extremely comprehensive and good, but its emphasis is on British usage.)\n\n2. Sorry about this phrase: I hate this phrase, too. This happens to be one of those very rare times when \"historical context\" is the phrase to use and there is no equivalent phrase that isn't even worse. (I actually tried \"lexico-temporal backdrop\" in one of the middle drafts, which I think you'll agree is not preferable.)\n\nINTERPOLATION\n\nThe above [paragraph] is motivated by the fact that this reviewer almost always sneers and/or winces when he sees \"historical context\" deployed in a piece of writing and thus hopes to head off any potential sneers/winces from the reader here, especially in an article about felicitous usage.\n\n3. SNOOT (n) (highly colloq) is this reviewer's nuclear family's nickname a clef for a really extreme usage fanatic, the sort of person whose idea of Sunday fun is to look for mistakes in Safire's column's prose itself. This reviewer's family is roughly 70 percent SNOOT, which term itself derives from an acronym, with the big historical family joke being that whether S.N.O.O.T. stood for \"Sprachgefuhl Necessitates Our Ongoing Tendance\" or \"Syntax Nudniks of Our Time\" depended on whether or not you were one.\n\n4. This is true in my own case at any rate \u2014 plus also the \"uncomfortable\" part. I teach college English part-time \u2014 mostly Lit, not Comp. But I am also so pathologically anal about(*) usage that every semester the same thing happens: The minute I have read my students' first set of papers, we immediately abandon the regular Lit syllabus and have a three-week Emergency Remedial Usage Unit, during which my demeanor is basically that of somebody teaching HIV prevention to intravenous-drug users. When it emerges (as it does, every time) that 95 percent of these intelligent upscale college students have never been taught, e.g., what a clause is or why a misplaced \"only\" can make a sentence confusing, I all but pound my head on the blackboard; I exhort them to sue their hometown school boards. The kids end up scared, both of me and for me.\n\n(*) Editor's Note: Author insisted this phrase replace \"obsessed with\" and took umbrage at the suggestion that this change clearly demonstrated the very quality he wished to denigrate.\n\n5. Please note that the strategically repeated 1-P pronoun is meant to iterate and emphasize that this reviewer is very much one too, a SNOOT, plus to connote the nuclear family mentioned supra. SNOOTitude runs in families. In ADMAU's Preface, Bryan Garner mentions both his father and grandfather and actually uses the word genetic, and it's probably true: 95 percent of the SNOOTs I know have at least one parent who is, by profession or temperament or both, a SNOOT. In my own case, my mom is a Comp teacher and has written remedial usage books and is a SNOOT of the most rabid and intractable sort. At least part of the reason I am a SNOOT is that for years Mom brainwashed us in all sorts of subtle ways. Here's an example. Family suppers often involved a game: If one of us children made a usage error. Mom would pretend to have a coughing fit that would go on and on until the relevant child had identified the relevant error and corrected it. It was all very self-ironic and lighthearted; but still, looking back, it seems a bit excessive to pretend that your child is actually denying you oxygen by speaking incorrectly. But the really chilling thing is that I now sometimes find myself playing this same \"game\" with my own students, complete with pretend pertussion.\n\nINTERPOLATION\n\nAs something I'm all but sure Harper's will excise, I'll also insert that we even had a lighthearted but retrospectively chilling little family song that Mom and we little SNOOTlets would sing in the car on long trips while Dad silently rolled his eyes and drove (you have to remember the title theme of Underdog in order to follow the song):\n\nWhen idiots in this world appear\nAnd fail to be concise or clear\nAnd solecisms rend the ear\nThe cry goes up both far and near\n\nFor Blunder Dog\n\nBlunder Dog\n\nBlunder Dog\n\nBlunder Dog\n\n[etc.](*)\n\n(*) (Since this'll almost surely get cut, I'll admit that, yes, I, as a kid, was the actual author of this song. But by this time I'd been thoroughly brainwashed. And just about the whole car sang along. It was sort of our family's version of \"100 Bottles ... Wall.\")\n\n6. If Samuel Johnson is the Shakespeare of English usage, think of Henry Watson Fowler as the Eliot or Joyce. His 1926 A Dictionary of Modern English Usage is the granddaddy of modern usage guides, and its dust-dry wit and blushless imperiousness have been models for every subsequent classic in the field, from Eric Partridge's Usage and Abusage to Theodore Bernstein's The Careful Writer to Wilson Follett's Modern American Usage to Gilman's '89 Webster's.\n\n7. (Garner prescribes spelling out only numbers under ten. I was taught that this rule applies just to Business Writing and that in all other modes you spell out one through nineteen and start using cardinals at 20.(*) De gustibus non est disputandum.)\n\n(*) Editor's Note: The Harper's style manual prescribes spelling out all numbers up to 100.\n\n8. From personal experience, I can assure you that any kid like this is going to be at best marginalized and at worst savagely and repeatedly Wedgied.\nBack\n\n9. What follow in the Preface are \"... the ten critical points that, after years of working on usage problems, I've settled on.\" These points are too involved to treat separately, but a couple of them are slippery in the extreme \u2014 e.g., \"10. Actual Usage. In the end, the actual usage of educated speakers and writers is the over arching criterion for correctness,\" of which both \"educated\" and \"actual\" would require several pages of abstract clarification and qualification to shore up against Usage Wars-related attacks, but which Garner rather ingeniously elects to define and defend via their application in his dictionary itself.\n\n10. There's no better indication of The Dictionary's authority than that we use it to settle wagers. My own father is still to this day living down the outcome of a high-stakes bet on the correct spelling of meringue, a wager made on 14 September 1978.\n\n11. Editor's Note: The Harper's style manual prescribes okay.\n\n12. This is a clever half-truth. Linguists compose only one part of the anti-judgment camp, and their objections to usage judgments involve way more than just \"subjectivity.\"\n\n13. In this last respect, recall for example W. J. Clinton's famous \"I feel your pain,\" which was a blatant if not particularly masterful Ethical Appeal.\n\n14. Really, howled, blistering reviews and outraged editorials from across the country \u2014 from the Times and The New Yorker and good old Life, or q.v. this from the January '62 Atlantic: \"We have seen a novel dictionary formula improvised, in great part, out of snap judgments and the sort of theoretical improvement that in practice impairs; and we have seen the gates propped wide open in enthusiastic hospitality to miscellaneous confusions and corruptions. In fine, the anxiously awaited work that was to have crowned cisatlantic linguistic scholarship with a particular glory turns out to be a scandal and a disaster.\"\n\n15. Note for example the mordant pith (and royal we) of this random snippet from Partridge's Usage and Abusage:\n\nanxious of. `I am not hopeless of our future. But I am\nprofoundly anxious of it', Beverley Nichols, News of England,\n1938: which made us profoundly anxious For (or about)\n\u2014 not of \u2014 Mr Nichols's literary future.\n\nOr see the near-Himalayan condescension of Fowler, here on some other people's use of words to mean things the words don't really mean:\n\nslipshod extension ... is especially likely to occur\nwhen some accident gives currency among the\nuneducated to words of learned origin, & the more\nif they are isolated or have few relatives in the\nvernacular.... The original meaning of feasible is\nsimply doable (L facere do); but to the unlearned\nit is a mere token, of which he has to infer the value\nfrom the contexts in which he hears it used, because\nsuch relatives as it has in English \u2014 Feat, feature,\nfaction, &c. \u2014 either fail to show the obvious\nfamily likeness to which he is accustomed among\nfamilies of indigenous words, or are (like malfeasance)\noutside his range.\n\n16. Utter bushwa: As ADMAU's body makes clear, Garner knows exactly when the Descriptivists started influencing language guides.\n\n17. (which in fact is true)\n\n18. (Q.v. \"The Pharmakon\" in Derrida's La dissemination \u2014 but you'd probably be better off just trusting me.)\n\n19. Standard Written English (SWE) is also sometimes called Standard English (SE) or Educated English, but the inditement-emphasis is the same.\n\nSEMI-INTERPOLATION\n\nPlus note that Garner's Preface explicitly names ADMAU's intended audience as \"writers and editors.\" And even ads for the dictionary in such organs as The New York Review of Books are built around the slogan \"If you like to WRITE ... Rear to us.\"(*)\n\n(*) (Yr. SNOOT rev. cannot help observing, w/r/t these ads, that the opening r in Refer here should not be capitalized after a dependent clause + ellipses \u2014 Quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus.)\n\n20. True, some sort of 100 percent compendious real-time Mega-dictionary might be possible online, though it'd take a small army of lexical webmasters and a much larger army of in situ actual-use reporters and surveillance techs; plus it'd be GNP-level expensive.\n\n21. New Criticism refers to T. S. Eliot and I. A. Richards and F. R. Leavis and Cleanth Brooks and Wimsatt & Beardsley and the whole \"close reading\" school that dominated literary criticism from WWI well into the seventies.\n\n22. (\"EVIDENCE OF CANCER LINK REFUTED BY TOBACCO INSTITUTE RESEARCHERS\")\n\n23. This proposition is in fact true, as is interpolatively demonstrated below, and although the demonstration is extremely persuasive it is also, as you can see from the size of this FN, lengthy and involved and rather, umm, dense, so that again you'd probably be better off simply granting the truth of the proposition and forging on with the main text.\n\nINTERPOLATIVE DEMONSTRATION OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A PRIVATE LANGUAGE\nIt's sometimes tempting to imagine that there can be such a things as Private Language. Many of us are prone to lay-philosophising about the weird privacy of our own mental states, for example, and from the fact that when my knee hurts only I can feel it, it's tempting to conclude that for me the word pain has a very subjective internal meaning that only I can truly understand. This line of thinking is sort of like the adolescent pot-smoker's terror that his own inner experience is both private and unverifiable, a syndrome that is techinically known as Cannabalic Solipsism. Eating ChipsAhoy! and staring very intently at the television's network PGA event, for instance, the adolescent potsmoker is struck by ghastly possibility that, e.g., what he sees as the color green and what other people call \"the color green\" may in fact not be the same color experiences at all The fact that both he and someone else call Pebble Beach's fairways green and a stoplight's GO signal green appears to guarantee only that there is a similar consistency in their color experience of fairways and GO lights, not that the actual subjective quality of those color experiences is the same; it could be that what the ad. pot-smoker experiences as green everyone else actually experiences as blue, and what we \"mean\" by the Word blue is what he \"means\" by green, etc., etc., until the Whole line of thinking gets so vexed and exhausting that the a.p.-s, ends up slumped crumb-strewn and paralyzed in his chair.\n\nThe point here is that the idea of a Private Language, like Private Colors and most of the other solipsistic conceits with which this particular reviewer has at various times been afflicted, is both deluded and demonstrably false.\n\nIn the case of Private Language, the delusion is usually based on the belief that a word such as pain has the meaning it does because it is somehow \"connected\" to a feeling in my knee. But as Mr. L. Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations proved in the 1950s, words actually have the meanings they do because of certain rules and verification tests that are imposed on us from outside our own subjectivities, viz., by the community in which we have to get along and communicate with other people. Wittgenstein's argument, which is admittedly very complex and gnomic and opaque, basically centers on the fact that a word like \"pain\" means what it does for me because of the way the community I'm part of has tacitly agreed to use \"pain\".\n\nIf you're thinking that all this fuss is not only abstract but also pretty irrelevant to the Usage Wars or to anything you have any real interest in at all, you are very much mistaken. If words' meanings depend on transpersonal rules and these rules on community consensus, language is not only conceptually non-Private but also irreducibly public, political, and ideological. This means that questions about our national consensus on grammar and usage arc actually bound up with every last social issue that millennial America's about \u2014 class, race, gender, morality, tolerance, pluralism, cohesion, equality, fairness, money: You name it.\n\n24. Norms, after all, are just practices people have agreed on as optimal ways of doing things for certain purposes. They're not laws, but they're not laissez-faire, either.\n\n25. In his The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language (1994), Steven Pinker puts it this way: \"No one, not even a valley girl, has to be told not to say 'Apples the eat boy' or 'The child seems sleeping' or 'Who did you meet John and?' or the vast, vast majority of the millions of trillions of mathematically possible combinations of words.\n\n26. In the Case of Steve Pinker Jr., those people are the boy's peers and teachers and crossing guards etc. In the case of adult cross-dressers and drag queens who have jobs in the Straight World and wear pants to those jobs, it's coworkers and clients and people on the subway. For the die-hard slob who nevertheless wears a coat and a tie to work, it's mostly his boss, who himself doesn't want his employee's clothes to send clients \"the wrong message.\" But of course it's all basically the same thing.\n\n27. In fact, the only time one ever hears the issue made explicit is in radio ads for tapes that promise to improve people's vocabulary. These ads are extremely ominous and intimidating and always start out with \"DID YOU KNOW PEOPLE JUDGE YOU BY THE WORDS YOU USE?\n\n28. (... not to mention color, gender, creed \u2014 you can see how fraught and charged all this is going to get)\n\n29. Discourse Community is an example of that rare kind of academic jargon that's actually a valuable addition to SWE because it captures something at once very complex and very specific that no other English term quite can.(*)\n\n(*) (The above is an obvious attempt to preempt readerly sneers/winces at the term's continued deployment in this article.)\n\n30. (Plus it's true that whether something gets called a \"subdialect\" or \"jargon\" seems to depend on how much it annoys people outside its Discourse Community. Garner himself has miniessays on AIRLINESE, COMPUTERESE, LEGALESE, and BUREAUCRATESE, and he more or less calls all of them jargon. There is no ADMAU miniessay on DIALECTS, but there is one On JARGON, in which such is Garner's self-restraint that you can almost hear his tendons straining, as in \" [Jargon] arises from the urge to save time and space \u2014 and occasionally to conceal meaning from the uninitiated.\")\n\n31. (a redundancy that's a bit arbitrary, since \"Where's it from?\" isn't redundant [mainly because whence has vanished into semi-archaism])\n\n32. A synthetic language uses inflections to dictate syntax, whereas an analytic language uses word order. Latin, German, and Russian are synthetic; English and Chinese, analytic.\n\n33. (Q.v. for example Sir Thomas Smith's cortex-withering De Recta et Emendata Linguae Anglicae Scriptione Dialogus of 1568.)\n\n34. But note that he's sane about it. Some split infinitives really are clunky and hard to parse, especially when there are a whole bunch of words between to and the verb \u2014 \"We will attempt to swiftly and to the best of our ability respond to these charges\" \u2014 which Garner calls \"wide splits\" and sensibly discourages. His overall verdict on s.i.'s \u2014 which is that some are \"perfectly proper\" and some iffy and some just totally bad news, and that no one wide tidy dogmatic ukase[???] can handle all s.i. cases, and thus that \"knowing when to split an infinitive requires a good ear and a keen eye\" \u2014 is a good example of the way Garner distinguishes sound and helpful Descriptivist objections from wacko or dogmatic objections and then incorporates the sound objections into a smarter and more flexible Prescriptivism.\n\n35. The SNOOTlet is, as it happens, an indispensable part of other kids' playground education. The kids are learning that a Group's identity depends as much on exclusion as inclusion. They are, in other words, starting to learn about Us and Them, and about how an Us always needs a Them because being not-Them is essential to being Us. Because they're kids and it's school, the obvious Them is the teachers and all the values and appurtenances of the teacher world. This teacher-Them helps the kids see how to start to be an Us, but the SNOOTlet completes the puzzle by providing the as it were missing link: He is the Traitor, the Us who is in fact not Us but Them.\n\nIn sum, the SNOOTier is teaching his peers that the criteria for membership in Us are not just age, station, inability to stay up past 9:00, etc. \u2014 that in fact Us is primarily a state of mind and a set of sensibilities. An ideology.\n\n36. (The skirt-in-school scenario was not personal stuff, FYI.)\n\n37. There are still Some of these teachers around, at least here in the Midwest. YOU know the type: lipless, tweedy, cancrine \u2014 Old Maids of both genders. If you had one (as I did, 1976-77), you surely remember him.\n\n38. (Or require us openly to acknowledge and talk about elitism, whereas a dogmatic SNOOT's pedagogy is merely elitism in action.)\n\n39. (I'm not a total idiot.)\n\n40. E.g., this is the reasoning behind many Pop Prescriptivists' complaint that shoddy usage signifies the Decline of Western Civilization.\n\n41. A Dictionary of Modern American Usage includes a miniessay on VOGUE WORDS, but it's a disappointing one in that Garner does little more than list VW's that bug him and say that \"vogue words have such a grip on the popular mind that they come to be used in contexts in which they serve little purpose.\" This is one of the rare places in ADMAU where Garner is simply wrong. The real problem is that every sentence blends and balances at least two different communicative functions \u2014 one the transmission of raw info, the other the transmission of certain stuff about the speaker \u2014 and Vogue Usage throws this balance off. Garher's \"serve little purpose\" is exactly incorrect; vogue words serve too much the purpose of presenting the speaker in a certain light (even if this is merely as with-it or hip), and people's subliminal B.S.-antennae pick this imbalance up, and that's why even nonSNOOTs often find Vogue Usage irritating and creepy.\n\n42. FYI, this passage, which appears in ADMAU's entry on OBSCURITY, is quoted from a 1997 Sacramento Bee article entitled \"No Contest: English Professors Are Worst Writers on Campus.\"\n\n43. This was in his 1946 \"Politics and the English Language,\" an essay that despite its date (and its title's basic redundancy) remains the definitive SNOOT statement on Academese. Orwell's famous AE translation of the gorgeous \"I saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift\" in Ecclesiastes as \"Objective considerations of contemporary phenomena compel the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account\" should be tattooed on the left wrist of every grad student in the anglophone world.\n\n44. Please just don't even say it.\n\n45.

Many of us are prone to lay-philosophising about the weird privacy of our own mental states, for example, and from the fact that when my knee hurts only I can feel it, it's tempting to conclude that for me the word pain has a very subjective internal meaning that only I can truly understand. This line of thinking is sort of like the adolescent pot-smoker's terror that his own inner experience is both private and unverifiable, a syndrome that is techinically known as Cannabalic Solipsism. Eating ChipsAhoy! and staring very intently at the television's network PGA event, for instance, the adolescent potsmoker is struck by ghastly possibility that, e.g., what he sees as the color green and what other people call \"the color green\" may in fact not be the same color experiences at all The fact that both he and someone else call Pebble Beach's fairways green and a stoplight's GO signal green appears to guarantee only that there is a similar consistency in their color experience of fairways and GO lights, not that the actual subjective quality of those color experiences is the same; it could be that what the ad. pot-smoker experiences as green everyone else actually experiences as blue, and what we \"mean\" by the Word blue is what he \"means\" by green, etc., etc., until the Whole line of thinking gets so vexed and exhausting that the a.p.-s, ends up slumped crumb-strewn and paralyzed in his chair.\n\nThe point here is that the idea of a Private Language, like Private Colors and most of the other solipsistic conceits with which this particular reviewer has at various times been afflicted, is both deluded and demonstrably false.\n\nIn the case of Private Language, the delusion is usually based on the belief that a word such as pain has the meaning it does because it is somehow \"connected\" to a feeling in my knee. But as Mr. L. Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investigations proved in the 1950s, words actually have the meanings they do because of certain rules and verification tests that are imposed on us from outside our own subjectivities, viz., by the community in which we have to get along and communicate with other people. Wittgenstein's argument, which is admittedly very complex and gnomic and opaque, basically centers on the fact that a word like \"pain\" means what it does for me because of the way the community I'm part of has tacitly agreed to use \"pain\".\n\nIf you're thinking that all this fuss is not only abstract but also pretty irrelevant to the Usage Wars or to anything you have any real interest in at all, you are very much mistaken. If words' meanings depend on transpersonal rules and these rules on community consensus, language is not only conceptually non-Private but also irreducibly public, political, and ideological. This means that questions about our national consensus on grammar and usage arc actually bound up with every last social issue that millennial America's about \u2014 class, race, gender, morality, tolerance, pluralism, cohesion, equality, fairness, money: You name it.\nBack\n\n24. Norms, after all, are just practices people have agreed on as optimal ways of doing things for certain purposes. They're not laws, but they're not laissez-faire, either.\nBack\n\n25. In his The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language (1994), Steven Pinker puts it this way: \"No one, not even a valley girl, has to be told not to say 'Apples the eat boy' or 'The child seems sleeping' or 'Who did you meet John and?' or the vast, vast majority of the millions of trillions of mathematically possible combinations of words.\nBack\n\n26. In the Case of Steve Pinker Jr., those people are the boy's peers and teachers and crossing guards etc. In the case of adult cross-dressers and drag queens who have jobs in the Straight World and wear pants to those jobs, it's coworkers and clients and people on the subway. For the die-hard slob who nevertheless wears a coat and a tie to work, it's mostly his boss, who himself doesn't want his employee's clothes to send clients \"the wrong message.\" But of course it's all basically the same thing.\nBack\n\n27. In fact, the only time one ever hears the issue made explicit is in radio ads for tapes that promise to improve people's vocabulary. These ads are extremely ominous and intimidating and always start out with \"DID YOU KNOW PEOPLE JUDGE YOU BY THE WORDS YOU USE?\nBack\n\n28. (... not to mention color, gender, creed \u2014 you can see how fraught and charged all this is going to get)\nBack\n\n29. Discourse Community is an example of that rare kind of academic jargon that's actually a valuable addition to SWE because it captures something at once very complex and very specific that no other English term quite can.(*)\n\n(*) (The above is an obvious attempt to preempt readerly sneers/winces at the term's continued deployment in this article.)\nBack\n\n30. (Plus it's true that whether something gets called a \"subdialect\" or \"jargon\" seems to depend on how much it annoys people outside its Discourse Community. Garner himself has miniessays on AIRLINESE, COMPUTERESE, LEGALESE, and BUREAUCRATESE, and he more or less calls all of them jargon. There is no ADMAU miniessay on DIALECTS, but there is one On JARGON, in which such is Garner's self-restraint that you can almost hear his tendons straining, as in \" [Jargon] arises from the urge to save time and space \u2014 and occasionally to conceal meaning from the uninitiated.\")\nBack\n\n31. (a redundancy that's a bit arbitrary, since \"Where's it from?\" isn't redundant [mainly because whence has vanished into semi-archaism])\nBack\n\n32. A synthetic language uses inflections to dictate syntax, whereas an analytic language uses word order. Latin, German, and Russian are synthetic; English and Chinese, analytic.\nBack\n\n33. (Q.v. for example Sir Thomas Smith's cortex-withering De Recta et Emendata Linguae Anglicae Scriptione Dialogus of 1568.)\nBack\n\n34. But note that he's sane about it. Some split infinitives really are clunky and hard to parse, especially when there are a whole bunch of words between to and the verb \u2014 \"We will attempt to swiftly and to the best of our ability respond to these charges\" \u2014 which Garner calls \"wide splits\" and sensibly discourages. His overall verdict on s.i.'s \u2014 which is that some are \"perfectly proper\" and some iffy and some just totally bad news, and that no one wide tidy dogmatic ukase[???] can handle all s.i. cases, and thus that \"knowing when to split an infinitive requires a good ear and a keen eye\" \u2014 is a good example of the way Garner distinguishes sound and helpful Descriptivist objections from wacko or dogmatic objections and then incorporates the sound objections into a smarter and more flexible Prescriptivism.\nBack\n\n35. The SNOOTlet is, as it happens, an indispensable part of other kids' playground education. The kids are learning that a Group's identity depends as much on exclusion as inclusion. They are, in other words, starting to learn about Us and Them, and about how an Us always needs a Them because being not-Them is essential to being Us. Because they're kids and it's school, the obvious Them is the teachers and all the values and appurtenances of the teacher world. This teacher-Them helps the kids see how to start to be an Us, but the SNOOTlet completes the puzzle by providing the as it were missing link: He is the Traitor, the Us who is in fact not Us but Them.\n\nIn sum, the SNOOTier is teaching his peers that the criteria for membership in Us are not just age, station, inability to stay up past 9:00, etc. \u2014 that in fact Us is primarily a state of mind and a set of sensibilities. An ideology.\nBack\n\n36. (The skirt-in-school scenario was not personal stuff, FYI.)\nBack\n\n37. There are still Some of these teachers around, at least here in the Midwest. YOU know the type: lipless, tweedy, cancrine \u2014 Old Maids of both genders. If you had one (as I did, 1976-77), you surely remember him.\nBack\n\n38. (Or require us openly to acknowledge and talk about elitism, whereas a dogmatic SNOOT's pedagogy is merely elitism in action.)\nBack\n\n39. (I'm not a total idiot.)\nBack\n\n40. E.g., this is the reasoning behind many Pop Prescriptivists' complaint that shoddy usage signifies the Decline of Western Civilization.\nBack\n\n41. A Dictionary of Modern American Usage includes a miniessay on VOGUE WORDS, but it's a disappointing one in that Garner does little more than list VW's that bug him and say that \"vogue words have such a grip on the popular mind that they come to be used in contexts in which they serve little purpose.\" This is one of the rare places in ADMAU where Garner is simply wrong. The real problem is that every sentence blends and balances at least two different communicative functions \u2014 one the transmission of raw info, the other the transmission of certain stuff about the speaker \u2014 and Vogue Usage throws this balance off. Garher's \"serve little purpose\" is exactly incorrect; vogue words serve too much the purpose of presenting the speaker in a certain light (even if this is merely as with-it or hip), and people's subliminal B.S.-antennae pick this imbalance up, and that's why even nonSNOOTs often find Vogue Usage irritating and creepy.\nBack\n\n42. FYI, this passage, which appears in ADMAU's entry on OBSCURITY, is quoted from a 1997 Sacramento Bee article entitled \"No Contest: English Professors Are Worst Writers on Campus.\"\nBack\n\n43. This was in his 1946 \"Politics and the English Language,\" an essay that despite its date (and its title's basic redundancy) remains the definitive SNOOT statement on Academese. Orwell's famous AE translation of the gorgeous \"I saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift\" in Ecclesiastes as \"Objective considerations of contemporary phenomena compel the conclusion that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of the unpredictable must invariably be taken into account\" should be tattooed on the left wrist of every grad student in the anglophone world.\nBack\n\n44.

tree\n\n[Verse 1: Leaf Dog]\nThe world is well balanced like karma is\nDo you find freedom on the front line where the army is\nOr in your mind opening the left part of this\nI feel it in-between my bones just like the cartilage\nWhen I'm parting this world I won't be sad\nThe true gift was the blessing of life that I've had\nYou can think that I'm mad, Ol' Leaf's on some hippy shit\nIt took a lot of changes in me to consider it\nInspired by an old ancient manuscript\nThe Mayans did predict\nBut can you handle it\nIt's a sign of the times that's hidden in the lines\nThe description is what the indigenous define\nAssure as the sun won't shine, and the rain falling\nThe balance is untold in this life we all in\nOn this misty morning, I zone, at one\nWith the things that molded how I've grown\n\n[Verse 2: BVA MC]\nLooking at the bigger picture\nThere'll always be people like Hitler\nAnd balancing it out\nMother Teresa tryna fix the world\nThen Ghandi making sure the scales don't tip turn\nThat darker side but thats just the mix in life's elixir\nWithout bad theres no good, without wood theres no fire\nWithout the hood the posh house price wouldn't be higher\nNo stronger no weaker, no stupid no deeper\nNo dick dropping rubbish theres no work for street sweepers\nWithout life there'd be no death\nAnd that I don't stop the pain\nJust concentrate on the memories they left\nWhen I'm looking at the stars I realise\nI'm just a speck on the Earth's surface\nI measure my worth by my intellect\nWe've all got a purpose, some people got three\nSome people fall in line and others have got dreams\nWe all do our best with the tools we were given\nShit my hammer and chisel is this life that I'm living'\n\n[Hook x2: Verb T]\nLife in the balance, scales of justice\nReach for answers, but failed to touch it\nMy mind lost in this, defined by my opposite\nLife in the balance, rise to the challenge\n\n[Verse 3: Verb T]\nEight steps away\nIn fact flip that eight on its side\nBecause now I infinitely chase\nFor that intimate embrace with lady luck\nI mean fuck, how long can someone stay in a rut?\nI'm like 'no'\nYou see thats all on me, to re-evaluate my goal\nAnd forget the greed, but sometimes I think\nDo I know myself? And if not\nIs that why I can't control myself?\nI got a family man I should be responsible\nSame time mind states held in that constant ball\nThat's why my girls so stressed hey\n'Cos I get under your skin like an X-Ray\nBut lets pray that it change for the best\nDeep breath to the chest, now I'm ready for the next day\nYour in life with the next brain\nTryna be the opposite like a sex change\nFocus head space\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 4: Fliptrix]\nIts like I'm standin' on the moon staring at the world\nTryna work out the balance of this life we hold\nIt's all a mystery encrypted in the Mayan scrolls\nThe cycle of the fifth sun is coming to a close\n2012 will only truly show us what that holds\nThe plot thickens as I stand here to break the mold\nGot my hands out, tryin' not to feel the cold\nBut some people walkin' by are fueled with an icy soul\nTools by they side, they take your life for your frigging phone\nOthers feel helpless, the selfless give a child a home\nRich feed the rich while the others just apply for loans\nMoney buys everything, but love that's the finest gold\nI gotta live fast and won't be dying barely old\nHedonistic lifestyles reflect how our lives unfold\nLife is one big cycle like the vinyl spinnin' round it goes\nAnd it goes\n\n[Verse 5: Jam Baxter]\nEquilibrium\nSee a billion desperate parts conjoined and deified brilliance\nGrand amphibians, submerged in slime\nEmerging like blood when blunt words collide\nThe sun burnt his eyes, the ice sliced his feet to bits\nBut you ain't gotta teach it shit\n'Cos the change is instinctual, the pace is unthinkable\nBut never put your faith in a fake individual\nBalance\nFrom the fangs and the mandibles and talons\nTo mannicles and batons to cannons\nTo mechanical contraptions, fashioned out of passion\nThat could turn the Earth back to a burnt black chasm\nShit happens\nAtoms, bound by compassion\nTo fractal patterns I saw spinning\nIn the caverns of my mind once, it all ties up\nIf I could see a bright sky shine when my eyes shut"}, {"Title": "What Happened", "Artist": "Dope D.O.D.", "Lyrics": "[Intro: Mulu]\nAyo, wassap, J.D.?

The Revolution of 1918 abolished the form of government, dissolved the army and abandoned the civil service to the corruption of party politics. Thus the essential supports of what is called the Authority of the State were shattered. This authority nearly always depends on three elements, which are the essential foundations of all authority.\n\nPopular support is the first element which is necessary for the creation of authority. But an authority resting on that foundation alone is still quite frail, uncertain and vacillating. Hence everyone who finds himself vested with an authority that is based only on popular support must take measures to improve and consolidate the foundations of that authority by the creation of force. Accordingly we must look upon power, that is to say, the capacity to use force, as the second foundation on which all authority is based. This foundation is more stable and secure, but not always stronger, than the first. If popular support and power are united together and can endure for a certain time, then an authority may arise which is based on a still stronger foundation, namely, the authority of tradition. And, finally, if popular support, power, and tradition are united together, then the authority based on them may be looked upon as invincible.\n\nIn Germany the Revolution abolished this last foundation. There was no longer even a traditional authority. With the collapse of the old Reich, the suppression of the monarchical form of government, the destruction of all the old insignia of greatness and the imperial symbols, tradition was shattered at a blow. The result was that the authority of the State was shaken to its foundations.\n\nThe second pillar of statal authority, namely power, also ceased to exist. In order to carry through the Revolution it was necessary to dissolve that body which had hitherto incorporated the organized force and power of the State, namely, the Army. Indeed, some detached fragments of the Army itself had to be employed as fighting elements in the Revolution. The Armies at the front were not subjected in the same measure to this process of disruption; but as they gradually left farther behind them the fields of glory on which they had fought heroically for four-and-half years, they were attacked by the solvent acid that had permeated the Fatherland; and when they arrived at the demobilizing centres they fell into that state of confusion which was styled voluntary obedience in the time of the Soldiers\u2019 Councils.\n\nOf course it was out of the question to think of founding any kind of authority on this crowd of mutineering soldiers, who looked upon military service as a work of eight hours per day. Therefore the second element, that which guarantees the stability of authority, was also abolished and the Revolution had only the original element, popular support, on which to build up its authority. But this basis was extraordinarily insecure. By means of a few violent thrusts the Revolution had shattered the old statal edifice to its deepest foundations, but only because the normal equilibrium within the social structure of the nation had already been destroyed by the war.\n\nEvery national body is made up of three main classes. At one extreme we have the best of the people, taking the word \u2018best\u2019 here to indicate those who are highly endowed with the civic virtues and are noted for their courage and their readiness to sacrifice their private interests. At the other extreme are the worst dregs of humanity, in whom vice and egotistic interests prevail. Between these two extremes stands the third class, which is made up of the broad middle stratum, who do not represent radiant heroism or vulgar vice.\n\nThe stages of a nation\u2019s rise are accomplished exclusively under the leadership of the best extreme.\n\nTimes of normal and symmetrical development, or of stable conditions, owe their existence and outwardly visible characteristics to the preponderating influence of the middle stratum. In this stage the two extreme classes are balanced against one another; in other words, they are relatively cancelled out.\n\nTimes of national collapse are determined by the preponderating influence of the worst elements.\n\nIt must be noted here, however, that the broad masses, which constitute what I have called the middle section, come forward and make their influence felt only when the two extreme sections are engaged in mutual strife. In case one of the extreme sections comes out victorious the middle section will readily submit to its domination. If the best dominate, the broad masses will follow it. Should the worst extreme turn out triumphant, then the middle section will at least offer no opposition to it; for the masses that constitute the middle class never fight their own battles.\n\nThe outpouring of blood for four-and-a-half years during the war destroyed the inner equilibrium between these three sections in so far as it can be said \u2013 though admitting the sacrifices made by the middle section \u2013 that the class which consisted of the best human elements almost completely disappeared through the loss of so much of its blood in the war, because it was impossible to replace the truly enormous quantity of heroic German blood which had been shed during those four-and-a-half years. In hundreds of thousands of cases it was always a matter of \u2018volunteers to the front\u2019, volunteers for patrol and duty, volunteer dispatch carriers, volunteers for establishing and working telephonic communications, volunteers for bridge-building, volunteers for the submarines, volunteers for the air service, volunteers for the storm battalions, and so on, and so on. During four-and-a-half years, and on thousands of occasions, there was always the call for volunteers and again for volunteers. And the result was always the same. Beardless young fellows or fully developed men, all filled with an ardent love for their country, urged on by their own courageous spirit or by a lofty sense of their duty \u2013 it was always such men who answered the call for volunteers. Tens of thousands, indeed hundreds of thousands, of such men came forward, so that that kind of human material steadily grew scarcer and scarcer. What did not actually fall was maimed in the fight or gradually had to join the ranks of the crippled because of the wounds they were constantly receiving, and thus they had to carry on interminably owing to the steady decrease in the supply of such men. In 1914 whole armies were composed of volunteers who, owing to a criminal lack of conscience on the part of our feckless parliamentarians, had not received any proper training in times of peace, and so were thrown as defenceless cannon-fodder to the enemy. The four hundred thousand who thus fell or were permanently maimed on the battlefields of Flanders could not be replaced any more. Their loss was something far more than merely numerical. With their death the scales, which were already too lightly weighed at that end of the social structure which represented our best human quality, now moved upwards rapidly, becoming heavier on the other end with those vulgar elements of infamy and cowardice \u2013 in short, there was an increase in the elements that constituted the worst extreme of our population.\n\nAnd there was something more: While for four-and-a-half years our best human material was being thinned to an exceptional degree on the battlefields, our worst people wonderfully succeeded in saving themselves. For each hero who made the supreme sacrifice and ascended the steps of Valhalla, there was a shirker who cunningly dodged death on the plea of being engaged in business that was more or less useful at home.\n\nAnd so the picture which presented itself at the end of the war was this: The great middle stratum of the nation had fulfilled its duty and paid its toll of blood. One extreme of the population, which was constituted of the best elements, had given a typical example of its heroism and had sacrificed itself almost to a man. The other extreme, which was constituted of the worst elements of the population, had preserved itself almost intact, through taking advantage of absurd laws and also because the authorities failed to enforce certain articles of the military code.\n\nThis carefully preserved scum of our nation then made the Revolution. And the reason why it could do so was that the extreme section composed of the best elements was no longer there to oppose it. It no longer existed.\n\nHence the German Revolution, from the very beginning, depended on only one section of the population. This act of Cain was not committed by the German people as such, but by an obscure canaille of deserters, hooligans, etc.\n\nThe man at the front gladly welcomed the end of the strife in which so much blood had been shed. He was happy to be able to return home and see his wife and children once again. But he had no moral connection with the Revolution. He did not like it, nor did he like those who had provoked and organized it. During the four-and-a-half years of that bitter struggle at the front he had come to forget the party hyenas at home and all their wrangling had become foreign to him.\n\nThe Revolution was really popular only with a small section of the German people: namely, that class and their accomplices who had selected the rucksack as the hall-mark of all honourable citizens in this new State. They did not like the Revolution for its own sake, though many people still erroneously believe the contrary, but for the consequences which followed in its train.\n\nBut it was very difficult to establish any abiding authority on the popular support given to these Marxist freebooters. And yet the young Republic stood in need of authority at any cost, unless it was ready to agree to be overthrown after a short period of chaos by an elementary force assembled from those last elements that still remained among the best extreme of the population.\n\nThe danger which those who were responsible for the Revolution feared most at that time was that, in the turmoil of the confusion which they themselves had created, the ground would suddenly be taken from under their feet, that they might be suddenly seized and transported to another terrain by an iron grip, such as has often appeared at these junctures in the history of nations. The Republic must be consolidated at all costs.\n\nHence it was forced almost immediately after its foundation to erect another pillar beside that wavering pillar of popularity. They found that power must be organized once again in order to procure a firmer foundation for their authority.\n\nWhen those who had been the matadors of the Revolution in December 1918, and January and February 1919, felt the ground trembling beneath their feet they looked around them for men who would be ready to reinforce them with military support; for their feeble position was dependent only on whatever popular favour they enjoyed. The \u2018anti-militarist\u2019 Republic had need of soldiers. But the first and only pillar on which the authority of the State rested, namely, its popularity, was grounded only on a conglomeration of rowdies and thieves, burglars, deserters, shirkers, etc. Therefore in that section of the nation which we have called the evil extreme it was useless to look for men who would be willing to sacrifice their lives on behalf of a new ideal. The section which had nourished the revolutionary idea and carried out the Revolution was neither able nor willing to call on the soldiers to protect it. For that section had no wish whatsoever to organize a republican State, but to disorganize what already existed and thus satisfy its own instincts all the better. Their password was not the organization and construction of the German Republic, but rather the plundering of it.\n\nHence the cry for help sent out by the public representatives, who were beset by a thousand anxieties, did not find any response among this class of people, but rather provoked a feeling of bitterness and repudiation. For they looked upon this step as the beginning of a breach of faith and trust, and in the building up of an authority which was no longer based on popular support but also on force they saw the beginning of a hostile move against what the Revolution meant essentially for those elements. They feared that measures might be taken against the right to robbery and absolute domination on the part of a horde of thieves and plunderers \u2013 in short, the worst rabble \u2013 who had broken out of the convict prisons and left their chains behind.\n\nThe representatives of the people might cry out as much as they liked, but they could get no help from that rabble. The cries for help were met with the counter-cry \u2018traitors\u2019 by those very people on whose support the popularity of the regime was founded.\n\nThen for the first time large numbers of young Germans were found who were ready to button on the military uniform once again in the service of \u2018Peace and Order\u2019, as they believed, shouldering the carbine and rifle and donning the steel helmet to defend the wreckers of the Fatherland. Volunteer corps were assembled and, although hating the Revolution, they began to defend it. The practical effect of their action was to render the Revolution firm and stable. In doing this they acted in perfect good faith.\n\nThe real organizer of the Revolution and the actual wire-puller behind it, the international Jew, had sized up the situation correctly. The German people were not yet ripe to be drawn into the blood swamp of Bolshevism, as the Russian people had been drawn. And that was because there was a closer racial union between the intellectual classes in Germany and the manual workers, and also because broad social strata were permeated with cultured people, such as was the case also in the other States of Western Europe; but this state of affairs was completely lacking in Russia. In that country the intellectual classes were mostly not of Russian nationality, or at least they did not have the racial characteristics of the Slav. The thin upper layer of intellectuals which then existed in Russia might be abolished at any time, because there was no intermediate stratum connecting it organically with the great mass of the people. There the mental and moral level of the great mass of the people was frightfully low.\n\nIn Russia the moment the agitators were successful in inciting broad masses of the people, who could not read or write, against the upper layer of intellectuals who were not in contact with the masses or permanently linked with them in any way \u2013 at that moment the destiny of Russia was decided, the success of the Revolution was assured. Thereupon the analphabetic Russian became the slave of his Jewish dictators who, on their side, were shrewd enough to name their dictatorship \u2018The Dictatorship of the People\u2019.\n\nIn the case of Germany an additional factor must be taken into account. Here the Revolution could be carried into effect only if the Army could first be gradually dismembered. But the real author of the Revolution and of the process of disintegration in the Army was not the soldier who had fought at the front but the canaille which more or less shunned the light and which were either quartered in the home garrisons or were officiating as \u2018indispensables\u2019 somewhere in the business world at home. This army was reinforced by ten thousand deserters who, without running any particular risk, could turn their backs on the Front. At all times the real poltroon fears nothing so much as death. But at the Front he had death before his eyes every day in a thousand different shapes. There has always been one possible way, and one only, of making weak or wavering men, or even downright poltroons, face their duty steadfastly. This means that the deserter must be given to understand that his desertion will bring upon him just the very thing he is flying from. At the Front a man may die, but the deserter must die. Only this draconian threat against every attempt to desert the flag can have a terrifying effect, not merely on the individual but also on the mass. Therein lay the meaning and purpose of the military penal code.\n\nIt was a fine belief to think that the great struggle for the life of a nation could be carried through if it were based solely on voluntary fidelity arising from and sustained by the knowledge that such a struggle was necessary. The voluntary fulfilment of one\u2019s duty is a motive that determines the actions of only the best men, but not of the average type of men. Hence special laws are necessary; just as, for instance, the law against stealing, which was not made for men who are honest on principle but for the weak and unstable elements. Such laws are meant to hinder the evil-doer through their deterrent effect and thus prevent a state of affairs from arising in which the honest man is considered the more stupid, and which would end in the belief that it is better to have a share in the robbery than to stand by with empty hands or allow oneself to be robbed.\n\nIt was a mistake to believe that in a struggle which, according to all human foresight, might last for several years it would be possible to dispense with those expedients which the experience of hundreds and even of thousands of years had proved to be effective in making weak and unstable men face and fulfil their duty in difficult times and at moments of great nervous stress.\n\nFor the voluntary war hero it is, of course, not necessary to have the death penalty in the military code, but it is necessary for the cowardly egoists who value their own lives more than the existence of the community in the hour of national need. Such weak and characterless people can be held back from surrendering to their cowardice only by the application of the heaviest penalties. When men have to struggle with death every day and remain for weeks in trenches of mire, often very badly supplied with food, the man who is unsure of himself and begins to waver cannot be made to stick to his post by threats of imprisonment or even penal servitude. Only by a ruthless enforcement of the death penalty can this be effected. For experience shows that at such a time the recruit considers prison a thousand times more preferable than the battlefield. In prison at least his precious life is not in danger. The practical abolition of the death penalty during the war was a mistake for which we had to pay dearly. Such omission really meant that the military penal code was no longer recognized as valid. An army of deserters poured into the stations at the rear or returned home, especially in 1918, and there began to form that huge criminal organization with which we were suddenly faced, after November 7th, 1918, and which perpetrated the Revolution.\n\nThe Front had nothing to do with all this. Naturally, the soldiers at the Front were yearning for peace. But it was precisely that fact which represented a special danger for the Revolution. For when the German soldiers began to draw near home, after the Armistice, the revolutionaries were in trepidation and asked the same question again and again: What will the troops from the Front do? Will the field-greys stand for it?\n\nDuring those weeks the Revolution was forced to give itself at least an external appearance of moderation, if it were not to run the risk of being wrecked in a moment by a few German divisions. For at that time, even if the commander of one division alone had made up his mind to rally the soldiers of his division, who had always remained faithful to him, in an onslaught to tear down the red flag and put the \u2018councils\u2019 up against the wall, or, if there was any resistance, to break it with trench-mortars and hand grenades, that division would have grown into an army of sixty divisions in less than four weeks. The Jew wire-pullers were terrified by this prospect more than by anything else; and to forestall this particular danger they found it necessary to give the Revolution a certain aspect of moderation. They dared not allow it to degenerate into Bolshevism, so they had to face the existing conditions by putting up the hypocritical picture of \u2018order and tranquillity\u2019. Hence many important concessions, the appeal to the old civil service and to the heads of the old Army. They would be needed at least for a certain time, and only when they had served the purpose of Turks\u2019 Heads could the deserved kick-out be administered with impunity. Then the Republic would be taken entirely out of the hands of the old servants of the State and delivered into the claws of the revolutionaries.\n\nThey thought that this was the only plan which would succeed in duping the old generals and civil servants and disarm any eventual opposition beforehand through the apparently harmless and mild character of the new regime.\n\nPractical experience has shown to what extent the plan succeeded.\n\nThe Revolution, however, was not made by the peaceful and orderly elements of the nation but rather by rioters, thieves and robbers. And the way in which the Revolution was developing did not accord with the intentions of these latter elements; still, on tactical grounds, it was not possible to explain to them the reasons for the course things were taking and make that course acceptable.\n\nAs Social Democracy gradually gained power it lost more and more the character of a crude revolutionary party. Of course in their inner hearts the Social Democrats wanted a revolution; and their leaders had no other end in view. Certainly not. But what finally resulted was only a revolutionary programme; but not a body of men who would be able to carry it out. A revolution cannot be carried through by a party of ten million members. If such a movement were attempted the leaders would find that it was not an extreme section of the population on which they had to depend butrather the broad masses of the middle stratum; hence the inert masses.\n\nRecognizing all this, already during the war, the Jews caused the famous split in the Social Democratic Party. While the Social Democratic Party, conforming to the inertia of its mass following, clung like a leaden weight on the neck of the national defence, the actively radical elements were extracted from it and formed into new aggressive columns for purposes of attack. The Independent Socialist Party and the Spartacist League were the storm battalions of revolutionary Marxism. The objective assigned to them was to create a fait accompli, on the grounds of which the masses of the Social Democratic Party could take their stand, having been prepared for this event long beforehand. The feckless bourgeoisie had been estimated at its just value by the Marxists and treated en canaille. Nobody bothered about it, knowing well that in their canine servility the representatives of an old and worn-out generation would not be able to offer any serious resistance.\n\nWhen the Revolution had succeeded and its artificers believed that the main pillars of the old State had been broken down, the Army returning from the Front began to appear in the light of a sinister sphinx and thus made it necessary to slow down the national course of the Revolution. The main body of the Social Democratic horde occupied the conquered positions, and the Independent Socialist and Spartacist storm battalions were side-tracked.\n\nBut that did not happen without a struggle.\n\nThe activist assault formations that had started the Revolution were dissatisfied and felt that they had been betrayed. They now wanted to continue the fight on their own account. But their illimitable racketeering became odious even to the wire-pullers of the Revolution. For the Revolution itself had scarcely been accomplished when two camps appeared. In the one camp were the elements of peace and order; in the other were those of blood and terror. Was it not perfectly natural that our bourgeoisie should rush with flying colours to the camp of peace and order? For once in their lives their piteous political organizations found it possible to act, inasmuch as the ground had been prepared for them on which they were glad to get a new footing; and thus to a certain extent they found themselves in coalition with that power which they hated but feared. The German political bourgeoisie achieved the high honour of being able to associate itself with the accursed Marxist leaders for the purpose of combating Bolshevism.\n\nThus the following state of affairs took shape as early as December 1918 and January 1919:\n\nA minority constituted of the worst elements had made the Revolution. And behind this minority all the Marxist parties immediately fell into step. The Revolution itself had an outward appearance of moderation, which aroused against it the enmity of the fanatical extremists. These began to launch hand-grenades and fire machine-guns, occupying public buildings, thus threatening to destroy the moderate appearance of the Revolution. To prevent this terror from developing further a truce was concluded between the representatives of the new regime and the adherents of the old order, so as to be able to wage a common fight against the extremists. The result was that the enemies of the Republic ceased to oppose the Republic as such and helped to subjugate those who were also enemies of the Republic, though for quite different reasons. But a further result was that all danger of the adherents of the old State putting up a fight against the new was now definitely averted.\n\nThis fact must always be clearly kept in mind. Only by remembering it can we understand how it was possible that a nation in which nine-tenths of the people had not joined in a revolution, where seven-tenths repudiated it and six-tenths detested it \u2013 how this nation allowed the Revolution to be imposed upon it by the remaining one-tenth of the population.\n\nGradually the barricade heroes in the Spartacist camp petered out, and so did the nationalist patriots and idealists on the other side. As these two groups steadily dwindled, the masses of the middle stratum, as always happens, triumphed. The Bourgeoisie and the Marxists met together on the grounds of accomplished facts, and the Republic began to be consolidated. At first, however, that did not prevent the bourgeois parties from propounding their monarchist ideas for some time further, especially at the elections, whereby they endeavoured to conjure up the spirits of the dead past to encourage their own feeble-hearted followers. It was not an honest proceeding. In their hearts they had broken with the monarchy long ago; but the foulness of the new regime had begun to extend its corruptive action and make itself felt in the camp of the bourgeois parties. The common bourgeois politician now felt better in the slime of republican corruption than in the severe decency of the defunct State, which still lived in his memory.\n\nAs I have already pointed out, after the destruction of the old Army the revolutionary leaders were forced to strengthen statal authority by creating a new factor of power. In the conditions that existed they could do this only by winning over to their side the adherents of a Weltanschhauung which was a direct contradiction of their own. From those elements alone it was possible slowly to create a new army which, limited numerically by the peace treaties, had to be subsequently transformed in spirit so as to become an instrument of the new regime.\n\nSetting aside the defects of the old State, which really became the cause of the Revolution, if we ask how it was possible to carry the Revolution to a successful issue as a political act, we arrive at the following conclusions:\n\nl. It was due to a process of dry rot in our conceptions of duty and obedience.\n\n2. It was due also to the passive timidity of the Parties who were supposed to uphold the State.\n\nTo this the following must be added: The dry rot which attacked our concepts of duty and obedience was fundamentally due to our wholly non-national and purely State education. From this came the habit of confusing means and ends. Consciousness of duty, fulfilment of duty, and obedience, are not ends in themselves no more than the State is an end in itself; but they all ought to be employed as means to facilitate and assure the existence of a community of people who are kindred both physically and spiritually. At a moment when a nation is manifestly collapsing and when all outward signs show that it is on the point of becoming the victim of ruthless oppression, thanks to the conduct of a few miscreants, to obey these people and fulfil one\u2019s duty towards them is merely doctrinaire formalism, and indeed pure folly; whereas, on the other hand, the refusal of obedience and fulfilment of duty in such a case might save the nation from collapse. According to our current bourgeois idea of the State, if a divisional general received from above the order not to shoot he fulfilled his duty and therefore acted rightly in not shooting, because to the bourgeois mind blind formal obedience is a more valuable thing than the life of a nation. But according to the National Socialist concept it is not obedience to weak superiors that should prevail at such moments, in such an hour the duty of assuming personal responsibility towards the whole nation makes its appearance.\n\nThe Revolution succeeded because that concept had ceased to be a vital force with our people, or rather with our governments, and died down to something that was merely formal and doctrinaire.\n\nAs regards the second point, it may be said that the more profound cause of the fecklessness of the bourgeois parties must be attributed to the fact that the most active and upright section of our people had lost their lives in the war. Apart from that, the bourgeois parties, which may be considered as the only political formations that stood by the old State, were convinced that they ought to defend their principles only by intellectual ways and means, since the use of physical force was permitted only to the State. That outlook was a sign of the weakness and decadence which had been gradually developing. And it was also senseless at a period when there was a political adversary who had long ago abandoned that standpoint and, instead of this, had openly declared that he meant to attain his political ends by force whenever that became possible. When Marxism emerged in the world of bourgeois democracy, as a consequence of that democracy itself, the appeal sent out by the bourgeois democracy to fight Marxism with intellectual weapons was a piece of folly for which a terrible expiation had to be made later on. For Marxism always professed the doctrine that the use of arms was a matter which had to be judged from the standpoint of expediency and that success justified the use of arms.\n\nThis idea was proved correct during the days from November 7 to 10, 1918. The Marxists did not then bother themselves in the least about parliament or democracy, but they gave the death blow to both by turning loose their horde of criminals to shoot and raise hell.\n\nWhen the Revolution was over the bourgeois parties changed the title of their firm and suddenly reappeared, the heroic leaders emerging from dark cellars or more lightsome storehouses where they had sought refuge. But, just as happens in the case of all representatives of antiquated institutions, they had not forgotten their errors or learned anything new. Their political programme was grounded in the past, even though they themselves had become reconciled to the new regime. Their aim was to secure a share in the new establishment, and so they continued the use of words as their sole weapon.\n\nTherefore after the Revolution the bourgeois parties also capitulated to the street in a miserable fashion.\n\nWhen the law for the Protection of the Republic was introduced the majority was not at first in favour of it. But, confronted with two hundred thousand Marxists demonstrating in the streets, the bourgeois \u2018statesmen\u2019 were so terror-stricken that they voted for the Law against their wills, for the edifying reason that otherwise they feared they might get their heads smashed by the enraged masses on leaving the Reichstag.\n\nAnd so the new State developed along its own course, as if there had been no national opposition at all.\n\nThe only organizations which at that time had the strength and courage to face Marxism and its enraged masses were first of all the volunteer corps 19), and subsequently the organizations for self-defence, the civic guards and finally the associations formed by the demobilized soldiers of the old Army.\n\nBut the existence of these bodies did not appreciably change the course of German history; and that for the following causes:\n\nAs the so-called national parties were without influence, because they had no force which could effectively demonstrate in the street, the Leagues of Defence could not exercise any influence because they had no political idea and especially because they had no definite political aim in view.\n\nThe success which Marxism once attained was due to perfect co-operation between political purposes and ruthless force. What deprived nationalist Germany of all practical hopes of shaping German development was the lack of a determined co-operation between brute force and political aims wisely chosen.\n\nWhatever may have been the aspirations of the \u2018national\u2019 parties, they had no force whatsoever to fight for these aspirations, least of all in the streets.\n\nThe Defence Leagues had force at their disposal. They were masters of the street and of the State, but they lacked political ideas and aims on behalf of which their forces might have been or could have been employed in the interests of the German nation. The cunning Jew was able in both cases, by his astute powers of persuasion, in reinforcing an already existing tendency to make this unfortunate state of affairs permanent and at the same time to drive the roots of it still deeper.\n\nThe Jew succeeded brilliantly in using his Press for the purpose of spreading abroad the idea that the defence associations were of a \u2018non-political\u2019 character just as in politics he was always astute enough to praise the purely intellectual character of the struggle and demand that it must always be kept on that plane\n\nMillions of German imbeciles then repeated this folly without having the slightest suspicion that by so doing they were, for all practical purposes, disarming themselves and delivering themselves defenceless into the hands of the Jew.\n\nBut there is a natural explanation of this also. The lack of a great idea which would re-shape things anew has always meant a limitation in fighting power. The conviction of the right to employ even the most brutal weapons is always associated with an ardent faith in the necessity for a new and revolutionary transformation of the world.\n\nA movement which does not fight for such high aims and ideals will never have recourse to extreme means.\n\nThe appearance of a new and great idea was the secret of success in the French Revolution. The Russian Revolution owes its triumph to an idea. And it was only the idea that enabled Fascism triumphantly to subject a whole nation to a process of complete renovation.\n\nBourgeois parties are not capable of such an achievement. And it was not the bourgeois parties alone that fixed their aim in a restoration of the past. The defence associations also did so, in so far as they concerned themselves with political aims at all. The spirit of the old war legions and Kyffauser tendencies lived in them and therewith helped politically to blunt the sharpest weapons which the German nation then possessed and allow them to rust in the hands of republican serfs. The fact that these associations were inspired by the best of intentions in so doing, and certainly acted in good faith, does not alter in the slightest degree the foolishness of the course they adopted.\n\nIn the consolidated Reichswehr Marxism gradually acquired the support of force, which it needed for its authority. As a logical consequence it proceeded to abolish those defence associations which it considered dangerous, declaring that they were now no longer necessary. Some rash leaders who defied the Marxist orders were summoned to court and sent to prison. But they all got what they had deserved.\n\nThe founding of the National Socialist German Labour Party incited a movement which was the first to fix its aim, not in a mechanical restoration of the past \u2013 as the bourgeois parties did \u2013 but in the substitution of an organic People\u2019s State for the present absurd statal mechanism.\n\nFrom the first day of its foundation the new movement took its stand on the principle that its ideas had to be propagated by intellectual means but that, wherever necessary, muscular force must be employed to support this propaganda. In accordance with their conviction of the paramount importance of the new doctrine, the leaders of the new movement naturally believe that no sacrifice can be considered too great when it is a question of carrying through the purpose of the movement.\n\nI have emphasized that in certain circumstances a movement which is meant to win over the hearts of the people must be ready to defend itself with its own forces against terrorist attempts on the part of its adversaries. It has invariably happened in the history of the world that formal State authority has failed to break a reign of terror which was inspired by a Weltanschhauung. It can only be conquered by a new and different Weltanschhauung whose representatives are quite as audacious and determined. The acknowledgment of this fact has always been very unpleasant for the bureaucrats who are the protectors of the State, but the fact remains nevertheless. The rulers of the State can guarantee tranquillity and order only in case the State embodies a Weltanschhauung which is shared in by the people as a whole; so that elements of disturbance can be treated as isolated criminals, instead of being considered as the champions of an idea which is diametrically opposed to official opinions. If such should be the case the State may employ the most violent measures for centuries long against the terror that threatens it; but in the end all these measures will prove futile, and the State will have to succumb.\n\nThe German State is intensely overrun by Marxism. In a struggle that went on for seventy years the State was not able to prevent the triumph of the Marxist idea. Even though the sentences to penal servitude and imprisonment amounted in all to thousands of years, and even though the most sanguinary methods of repression were in innumerable instances threatened against the champions of the Marxist Weltanschhauung, in the end the State was forced to capitulate almost completely. The ordinary bourgeois political leaders will deny all this, but their protests are futile.\n\nSeeing that the State capitulated unconditionally to Marxism on November 9th, 1918, it will not suddenly rise up tomorrow as the conqueror of Marxism. On the contrary. Bourgeois simpletons sitting on office stools in the various ministries babble about the necessity of not governing against the wishes of the workers, and by the word \u2018workers\u2019 they mean the Marxists. By identifying the German worker with Marxism not only are they guilty of a vile falsification of the truth, but they thus try to hide their own collapse before the Marxist idea and the Marxist organization.\n\nIn view of the complete subordination of the present State to Marxism, the National Socialist Movement feels all the more bound not only to prepare the way for the triumph of its idea by appealing to the reason and understanding of the public but also to take upon itself the responsibility of organizing its own defence against the terror of the International, which is intoxicated with its own victory.\n\nI have already described how practical experience in our young movement led us slowly to organize a system of defence for our meetings. This gradually assumed the character of a military body specially trained for the maintenance of order, and tended to develop into a service which would have its properly organized cadres.\n\nThis new formation might resemble the defence associations externally, but in reality there were no grounds of comparison between the one and the other.\n\nAs I have already said, the German defence organizations did not have any definite political ideas of their own. They really were only associations for mutual protection, and they were trained and organized accordingly, so that they were an illegal complement or auxiliary to the legal forces of the State. Their character as free corps arose only from the way in which they were constructed and the situation in which the State found itself at that time. But they certainly could not claim to be free corps on the grounds that they were associations formed freely and privately for the purpose of fighting for their own freely formed political convictions. Such they were not, despite the fact that some of their leaders and some associations as such were definitely opposed to the Republic. For before we can speak of political convictions in the higher sense we must be something more than merely convinced that the existing regime is defective. Political convictions in the higher sense mean that one has the picture of a new regime clearly before one\u2019s mind, feels that the establishment of this regime is an absolute necessity and sets himself to carry out that purpose as the highest task to which his life can be devoted.\n\nThe troops for the preservation of order, which were then formed under the National Socialist Movement, were fundamentally different from all the other defence associations by reason of the fact that our formations were not meant in any way to defend the state of things created by the Revolution, but rather that they were meant exclusively to support our struggle for the creation of a new Germany.\n\nIn the beginning this body was merely a guard to maintain order at our meetings. Its first task was limited to making it possible for us to hold our meetings, which otherwise would have been completely prevented by our opponents. These men were at that time trained merely for purposes of attack, but they were not taught to adore the big stick exclusively, as was then pretended in stupid German patriotic circles. They used the cudgel because they knew that it can be made impossible for high ideals to be put forward if the man who endeavours to propagate them can be struck down with the cudgel. As a matter of fact, it has happened in history not infrequently that some of the greatest minds have perished under the blows of the most insignificant helots. Our bodyguards did not look upon violence as an end in itself, but they protected the expositors of ideal aims and purposes against hostile coercion by violence. They also understood that there was no obligation to undertake the defence of a State which did not guarantee the defence of the nation, but that, on the contrary, they had to defend the nation against those who were threatening to destroy nation and State.\n\nAfter the fight which took place at the meeting in the Munich Hofbr\u00e4uhaus, where the small number of our guards who were present won everlasting fame for themselves by the heroic manner in which they stormed the adversaries; these guards were called The Storm Detachment. As the name itself indicates, they represent only a detachment of the Movement. They are one constituent element of it, just as is the Press, the propaganda, educational institutes, and other sections of the Party.\n\nWe learned how necessary was the formation of such a body, not only from our experience on the occasion of that memorable meeting but also when we sought gradually to carry the Movement beyond Munich and extend it to the other parts of Germany. Once we had begun to appear as a danger to Marxism the Marxists lost no opportunity of trying to crush beforehand all preparations for the holding of National Socialist meetings. When they did not succeed in this they tried to break up the meeting itself. It goes without saying that all the Marxist organizations, no matter of what grade or view, blindly supported the policy and activities of their representations in every case. But what is to be said of the bourgeois parties who, when they were reduced to silence by these same Marxists and in many places did not dare to send their speakers to appear before the public, yet showed themselves pleased, in a stupid and incomprehensible manner, every time we received any kind of set-back in our fight against Marxism. The bourgeois parties were happy to think that those whom they themselves could not stand up against, but had to knuckle down to, could not be broken by us. What must be said of those State officials, chiefs of police, and even cabinet ministers, who showed a scandalous lack of principle in presenting themselves externally to the public as \u2018national\u2019 and yet shamelessly acted as the henchmen of the Marxists in the disputes which we, National Socialists, had with the latter. What can be said of persons who debased themselves so far, for the sake of a little abject praise in the Jewish Press, that they persecuted those men to whose heroic courage and intervention, regardless of risk, they were partly indebted for not having been torn to pieces by the Red mob a few years previously and strung up to the lamp-posts?\n\nOne day these lamentable phenomena fired the late but unforgotten Prefect P\u00f6hner \u2013 a man whose unbending straightforwardness forced him to hate all twisters and to hate them as only a man with an honest heart can hate \u2013 to say: \"In all my life I wished to be first a German and then an official, and I never wanted to mix up with these creatures who, as if they were kept officials, prostituted themselves before anybody who could play lord and master for the time being.\"\n\nIt was a specially sad thing that gradually tens of thousands of honest and loyal servants of the State did not only come under the power of such people but were also slowly contaminated by their unprincipled morals. Moreover, these kind of men pursued honest officials with a furious hatred, degrading them and driving them from their positions, and yet passed themselves off as \u2018national\u2019 by the aid of their lying hypocrisy.\n\nFrom officials of that kind we could expect no support, and only in very rare instances was it given. Only by building up its own defence could our movement become secure and attract that amount of public attention and general respect which is given to those who can defend themselves when attacked.\n\nAs an underlying principle in the internal development of the Storm Detachment, we came to the decision that not only should it be perfectly trained in bodily efficiency but that the men should be so instructed as to make them indomitably convinced champions of the National Socialist ideas and, finally, that they should be schooled to observe the strictest discipline. This body was to have nothing to do with the defence organizations of the bourgeois type and especially not with any secret organization.\n\nMy reasons at that time for guarding strictly against letting the Storm Detachment of the German National Socialist Labour Party appear as a defence association were as follows:\n\nOn purely practical grounds it is impossible to build up a national defence organization by means of private associations, unless the State makes an enormous contribution to it. Whoever thinks otherwise overestimates his own powers. Now it is entirely out of the question to form organizations of any military value for a definite purpose on the principle of so-called \u2018voluntary discipline\u2019. Here the chief support for enforcing orders, namely, the power of inflicting punishment, is lacking. In the autumn, or rather in the spring, of 1919 it was still possible to raise \u2018volunteer corps\u2019, not only because most of the men who came forward at that time had been through the school of the old Army, but also because the kind of duty imposed there constrained the individual to absolute obedience at least for a definite period of time.\n\nThat spirit is entirely lacking in the volunteer defence organizations of to-day. The more the defence association grows, the weaker its discipline becomes and so much the less can one demand from the individual members. Thus the whole organization will more and more assume the character of the old non-political associations of war comrades and veterans.\n\nIt is impossible to carry through a voluntary training in military service for larger masses unless one is assured absolute power of command. There will always be few men who will voluntarily and spontaneously submit to that kind of obedience which is considered natural and necessary in the Army.\n\nMoreover, a proper system of military training cannot be developed where there are such ridiculously scanty means as those at the disposal of the defence associations. The principal task of such an institution must be to impart the best and most reliable kind of instruction. Eight years have passed since the end of the War, and during that time none of our German youth, at an age when formerly they would have had to do military service, have received any systematic training at all. The aim of a defence association cannot be to enlist here and now all those who have already received a military training; for in that case it could be reckoned with mathematical accuracy when the last member would leave the association. Even the younger soldier from 1918 will no longer be fit for front-line service twenty years later, and we are approaching that state of things with a rapidity that gives cause for anxiety. Thus the defence associations must assume more and more the aspect of the old ex-service men\u2019s societies. But that cannot be the meaning and purpose of an institution which calls itself, not an association of ex-service men but a defence association, indicating by this title that it considers its task to be, not only to preserve the tradition of the old soldiers and hold them together but also to propagate the idea of national defence and be able to carry this idea into practical effect, which means the creation of a body of men who are fit and trained for military defence.\n\nBut this implies that those elements will receive a military training which up to now have received none. This is something that in practice is impossible for the defence associations. Real soldiers cannot be made by a training of one or two hours per week. In view of the enormously increasing demands which modern warfare imposes on each individual soldier to-day, a military service of two years is barely sufficient to transform a raw recruit into a trained soldier. At the Front during the War we all saw the fearful consequences which our young recruits had to suffer from their lack of a thorough military training. Volunteer formations which had been drilled for fifteen or twenty weeks under an iron discipline and shown unlimited self-denial proved nevertheless to be no better than cannon fodder at the Front. Only when distributed among the ranks of the old and experienced soldiers could the young recruits, who had been trained for four or six months, become useful members of a regiment. Guided by the \u2018old men\u2019, they adapted themselves gradually to their task.\n\nIn the light of all this, how hopeless must the attempt be to create a body of fighting troops by a so-called training of one or two hours in the week, without any definite power of command and without any considerable means. In that way perhaps one could refresh military training in old soldiers, but raw recruits cannot thus be transformed into expert soldiers.\n\nHow such a proceeding produces utterly worthless results may also be demonstrated by the fact that at the same time as these so-called volunteer defence associations, with great effort and outcry and under difficulties and lack of necessities, try to educate and train a few thousand men of goodwill (the others need not be taken into account) for purposes of national defence, the State teaches our young men democratic and pacifist ideas and thus deprives millions and millions of their national instincts, poisons their logical sense of patriotism and gradually turns them into a herd of sheep who will patiently follow any arbitrary command. Thus they render ridiculous all those attempts made by the defence associations to inculcate their ideas in the minds of the German youth.\n\nAlmost more important is the following consideration, which has always made me take up a stand against all attempts at a so-called military training on the basis of the volunteer associations.\n\nAssuming that, in spite of all the difficulties just mentioned, a defence association were successful in training a certain number of Germans every year to be efficient soldiers, not only as regards their mental outlook but also as regards bodily efficiency and the expert handling of arms, the result must necessarily be null and void in a State whose whole tendency makes it not only look upon such a defensive formation as undesirable but even positively hate it, because such an association would completely contradict the intimate aims of the political leaders, who are the corrupters of this State.\n\nBut anyhow, such a result would be worthless under governments which have demonstrated by their own acts that they do not lay the slightest importance on the military power of the nation and are not disposed to permit an appeal to that power only in case that it were necessary for the protection of their own malignant existence.\n\nAnd that is the state of affairs to-day. It is not ridiculous to think of training some ten thousand men in the use of arms, and carry on that training surreptitiously, when a few years previously the State, having shamefully sacrificed eight-and-a-half million highly trained soldiers, not merely did not require their services any more, but, as a mark of gratitude for their sacrifices, held them up to public contumely. Shall we train soldiers for a regime which besmirched and spat upon our most glorious soldiers, tore the medals and badges from their breasts, trampled on their flags and derided their achievements? Has the present regime taken one step towards restoring the honour of the old army and bringing those who destroyed and outraged it to answer for their deeds? Not in the least. On the contrary, the people I have just referred to may be seen enthroned in the highest positions under the State to-day. And yet it was said at Leipzig: \"Right goes with might.\" Since, however, in our Republic to-day might is in the hands of the very men who arranged for the Revolution, and since that Revolution represents a most despicable act of high treason against the nation \u2013 yea, the vilest act in German history \u2013 there can surely be no grounds for saying that might of this character should be enhanced by the formation of a new young army. It is against all sound reason.\n\nThe importance which this State attached, after the Revolution of 1918, to the reinforcement of its position from the military point of view is clearly and unmistakably demonstrated by its attitude towards the large self-defence organizations which existed in that period. They were not unwelcome as long as they were of use for the personal protection of the miserable creatures cast up by the Revolution.\n\nBut the danger to these creatures seemed to disappear as the debasement of our people gradually increased. As the existence of the defence associations no longer implied a reinforcement of the national policy they became superfluous. Hence every effort was made to disarm them and suppress them wherever that was possible.\n\nHistory records only a few examples of gratitude on the part of princes. But there is not one patriot among the new bourgeoisie who can count on the gratitude of revolutionary incendiaries and assassins, persons who have enriched themselves from the public spoil and betrayed the nation. In examining the problem as to the wisdom of forming these defence associations I have never ceased to ask: \u2018For whom shall I train these young men? For what purpose will they be employed when they will have to be called out?\u2019 The answer to these questions lays down at the same time the best rule for us to follow.\n\nIf the present State should one day have to call upon trained troops of this kind it would never be for the purpose of defending the interests of the nation vis-\u00e0-vis those of the stranger but rather to protect the oppressors of the nation inside the country against the danger of a general outbreak of wrath on the part of a nation which has been deceived and betrayed and whose interests have been bartered away.\n\nFor this reason it was decided that the Storm Detachment of the German National Socialist Labour Party ought not to be in the nature of a military organization. It had to be an instrument of protection and education for the National Socialist Movement and its duties should be in quite a different sphere from that of the military defence association.\n\nAnd, of course, the Storm Detachment should not be in the nature of a secret organization. Secret organizations are established only for purposes that are against the law. Therewith the purpose of such an organization is limited by its very nature. Considering the loquacious propensities of the German people, it is not possible to build up any vast organization, keeping it secret at the same time and cloaking its purpose. Every attempt of that kind is destined to turn out absolutely futile. It is not merely that our police officials to-day have at their disposal a staff of eaves-droppers and other such rabble who are ready to play traitor, like Judas, for thirty pieces of silver and will betray whatever secrets they can discover and will invent what they would like to reveal. In order to forestall such eventualities, it is never possible to bind one\u2019s own followers to the silence that is necessary. Only small groups can become really secret societies, and that only after long years of filtration. But the very smallness of such groups would deprive them of all value for the National Socialist Movement. What we needed then and need now is not one or two hundred dare-devil conspirators but a hundred thousand devoted champions of our Weltanschhauung. The work must not be done through secret conventicles but through formidable mass demonstrations in public. Dagger and pistol and poison-vial cannot clear the way for the progress of the movement. That can be done only by winning over the man in the street. We must overthrow Marxism, so that for the future National Socialism will be master of the street, just as it will one day become master of the State.\n\nThere is another danger connected with secret societies. It lies in the fact that their members often completely misunderstand the greatness of the task in hand and are apt to believe that a favourable destiny can be assured for the nation all at once by means of a single murder. Such a belief may find historical justification by appealing to cases where a nation had been suffering under the tyranny of some oppressor who at the same time was a man of genius and whose extraordinary personality guaranteed the internal solidity of his position and enabled him to maintain his fearful oppression. In such cases a man may suddenly arise from the ranks of the people who is ready to sacrifice himself and plunge the deadly steel into the heart of the hated individual. In order to look upon such a deed as abhorrent one must have the republican mentality of that petty canaille who are conscious of their own crime. But the greatest champion 20) of liberty that the German people have ever had has glorified such a deed in William Tell.\n\nDuring 1919 and 1920 there was danger that the members of secret organizations, under the influence of great historical examples and overcome by the immensity of the nation\u2019s misfortunes, might attempt to wreak vengeance on the destroyers of their country, under the belief that this would end the miseries of the people. All such attempts were sheer folly, for the reason that the Marxist triumph was not due to the superior genius of one remarkable person but rather to immeasurable incompetence and cowardly shirking on the part of the bourgeoisie. The hardest criticism that can be uttered against our bourgeoisie is simply to state the fact that it submitted to the Revolution, even though the Revolution did not produce one single man of eminent worth. One can always understand how it was possible to capitulate before a Robespierre, a Danton, or a Marat; but it was utterly scandalous to go down on all fours before the withered Scheidemann, the obese Herr Erzberger, Frederick Ebert, and the innumerable other political pigmies of the Revolution. There was not a single man of parts in whom one could see the revolutionary man of genius. Therein lay the country\u2019s misfortune; for they were only revolutionary bugs, Spartacists wholesale and retail. To suppress one of them would be an act of no consequence. The only result would be that another pair of bloodsuckers, equally fat and thirsty, would be ready to take his place.\n\nDuring those years we had to take up a determined stand against an idea which owed its origin and foundation to historical episodes that were really great, but to which our own despicable epoch did not bear the slightest similarity.\n\nThe same reply may be given when there is question of putting somebody \u2018on the spot\u2019 who has acted as a traitor to his country. It would be ridiculous and illogical to shoot a poor wretch 21) who had betrayed the position of a howitzer to the enemy while the highest positions of the government are occupied by a rabble who bartered away a whole empire, who have on their consciences the deaths of two million men who were sacrificed in vain, fellows who were responsible for the millions maimed in the war and who make a thriving business out of the republican regime without allowing their souls to be disturbed in any way. It would be absurd to do away with small traitors in a State whose government has absolved the great traitors from all punishment. For it might easily happen that one day an honest idealist, who, out of love for his country, had removed from circulation some miserable informer that had given information about secret stores of arms might now be called to answer for his act before the chief traitors of the country. And there is still an important question: Shall some small traitorous creature be suppressed by another small traitor, or by an idealist? In the former case the result would be doubtful and the deed would almost surely be revealed later on. In the second case a petty rascal is put out of the way and the life of an idealist who may be irreplaceable is in jeopardy.\n\nFor myself, I believe that small thieves should not be hanged while big thieves are allowed to go free. One day a national tribunal will have to judge and sentence some tens of thousands of organizers who were responsible for the criminal November betrayal and all the consequences that followed on it. Such an example will teach the necessary lesson, once and for ever, to those paltry traitors who revealed to the enemy the places where arms were hidden.\n\nOn the grounds of these considerations I steadfastly forbade all participation in secret societies, and I took care that the Storm Detachment should not assume such a character. During those years I kept the National Socialist Movement away from those experiments which were being undertaken by young Germans who for the most part were inspired with a sublime idealism but who became the victims of their own deeds, because they could not ameliorate the lot of their fatherland to the slightest degree.\n\nIf then the Storm Detachment must not be either a military defence organization or a secret society, the following conclusions must result:\n\n1. Its training must not be organized from the military standpoint but from the standpoint of what is most practical for party purposes. Seeing that its members must undergo a good physical training, the place of chief importance must not be given to military drill but rather to the practice of sports. I have always considered boxing and ju-jitsu more important than some kind of bad, because mediocre, training in rifle-shooting. If the German nation were presented with a body of young men who had been perfectly trained in athletic sports, who were imbued with an ardent love for their country and a readiness to take the initiative in a fight, then the national State could make an army out of that body within less than two years if it were necessary, provided the cadres already existed. In the actual state of affairs only the Reichswehr could furnish the cadres and not a defence organization that was neither one thing nor the other. Bodily efficiency would develop in the individual a conviction of his superiority and would give him that confidence which is always based only on the consciousness of one\u2019s own powers. They must also develop that athletic agility which can be employed as a defensive weapon in the service of the Movement.\n\n2. In order to safeguard the Storm Detachment against any tendency towards secrecy, not only must the uniform be such that it can immediately be recognized by everybody, but the large number of its effectives show the direction in which the Movement is going and which must be known to the whole public. The members of the Storm Detachment must not hold secret gatherings but must march in the open and thus, by their actions, put an end to all legends about a secret organization. In order to keep them away from all temptations towards finding an outlet for their activities in small conspiracies, from the very beginning we had to inculcate in their minds the great idea of the Movement and educate them so thoroughly to the task of defending this idea that their horizon became enlarged and that the individual no longer considered it his mission to remove from circulation some rascal or other, whether big or small, but to devote himself entirely to the task of bringing about the establishment of a new National Socialist People\u2019s State. In this way the struggle against the present State was placed on a higher plane than that of petty revenge and small conspiracies. It was elevated to the level of a spiritual struggle on behalf of a Weltanschhauung, for the destruction of Marxism in all its shapes and forms.\n\n3. The form of organization adopted for the Storm Detachment, as well as its uniform and equipment, had to follow different models from those of the old Army. They had to be specially suited to the requirements of the task that was assigned to the Storm Detachment.\n\nThese were the ideas I followed in 1920 and 1921. I endeavoured to instil them gradually into the members of the young organization. And the result was that by the midsummer of 1922 we had a goodly number of formations which consisted of a hundred men each. By the late autumn of that year these formations received their distinctive uniforms. There were three events which turned out to be of supreme importance for the subsequent development of the Storm Detachment.\n\n1. The great mass demonstration against the Law for the Protection of the Republic. This demonstration was held in the late summer of 1922 on the K\u00f6nigs-platz in Munich, by all the patriotic societies. The National Socialist Movement also participated in it. The march-past of our party, in serried ranks, was led by six Munich companies of a hundred men each, followed by the political sections of the Party. Two bands marched with us and about fifteen flags were carried. When the National Socialists arrived at the great square it was already half full, but no flag was flying. Our entry aroused unbounded enthusiasm. I myself had the honour of being one of the speakers who addressed that mass of about sixty thousand people.\n\nThe demonstration was an overwhelming success; especially because it was proved for the first time that nationalist Munich could march on the streets, in spite of all threats from the Reds. Members of the organization for the defence of the Red Republic endeavoured to hinder the marching columns by their terrorist activities, but they were scattered by the companies of the Storm Detachment within a few minutes and sent off with bleeding skulls. The National Socialist Movement had then shown for the first time that in future it was determined to exercise the right to march on the streets and thus take this monopoly away from the international traitors and enemies of the country.\n\nThe result of that day was an incontestable proof that our ideas for the creation of the Storm Detachment were right, both from the psychological viewpoint and as to the manner in which this body was organized.\n\nOn the basis of this success the enlistment progressed so rapidly that within a few weeks the number of Munich companies of a hundred men each became doubled.\n\n2. The expedition to Coburg in October 1922.\n\nCertain People\u2019s Societies had decided to hold a German Day at Coburg. I was invited to take part, with the intimation that they wished me to bring a following along. This invitation, which I received at eleven o\u2019clock in the morning, arrived just in time. Within an hour the arrangements for our participation in the German Congress were ready. I picked eight hundred men of the Storm Detachment to accompany me. These were divided into about fourteen companies and had to be brought by special train from Munich to Coburg, which had just voted by plebiscite to be annexed to Bavaria. Corresponding orders were given to other groups of the National Socialist Storm Detachment which had meanwhile been formed in various other localities.\n\nThis was the first time that such a special train ran in Germany. At all the places where the new members of the Storm Detachment joined us our train caused a sensation. Many of the people had never seen our flag. And it made a very great impression.\n\nAs we arrived at the station in Coburg we were received by a deputation of the organizing committee of the German Day. They announced that it had been \u2018arranged\u2019 at the orders of local trades unions \u2013 that is to say, the Independent and Communist Parties \u2013 that we should not enter the town with our flags unfurled and our band playing (we had a band consisting of forty-two musicians with us) and that we should not march with closed ranks.\n\nI immediately rejected these unmilitary conditions and did not fail to declare before the gentlemen who had arranged this \u2018day\u2019 how astonished I was at the idea of their negotiating with such people and coming to an agreement with them. Then I announced that the Storm Troops would immediately march into the town in company formation, with our flags flying and the band playing.\n\nAnd that is what happened.\n\nAs we came out into the station yard we were met by a growling and yelling mob of several thousand, that shouted at us: \u2018Assassins\u2019, \u2018Bandits\u2019, \u2018Robbers\u2019, \u2018Criminals\u2019. These were the choice names which these exemplary founders of the German Republic showered on us. The young Storm Detachment gave a model example of order. The companies fell into formation on the square in front of the station and at first took no notice of the insults hurled at them by the mob. The police were anxious. They did not pilot us to the quarters assigned to us on the outskirts of Coburg, a city quite unknown to us, but to the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus Keller in the centre of the town. Right and left of our march the tumult raised by the accompanying mob steadily increased. Scarcely had the last company entered the courtyard of the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus when the huge mass made a rush to get in after them, shouting madly. In order to prevent this, the police closed the gates. Seeing the position was untenable I called the Storm Detachment to attention and then asked the police to open the gates immediately. After a good deal of hesitation, they consented.\n\nWe now marched back along the same route as we had come, in the direction of our quarters, and there we had to make a stand against the crowd. As their cries and yells all along the route had failed to disturb the equanimity of our companies, the champions of true Socialism, Equality, and Fraternity now took to throwing stones. That brought our patience to an end. For ten minutes long, blows fell right and left, like a devastating shower of hail. Fifteen minutes later there were no more Reds to be seen in the street.\n\nThe collisions which took place when the night came on were more serious. Patrols of the Storm Detachment had discovered National Socialists who had been attacked singly and were in an atrocious state. Thereupon we made short work of the opponents. By the following morning the Red terror, under which Coburg had been suffering for years, was definitely smashed.\n\nAdopting the typically Marxist and Jewish method of spreading falsehoods, leaflets were distributed by hand on the streets, bearing the caption: \"Comrades and Comradesses of the International Proletariat.\" These leaflets were meant to arouse the wrath of the populace. Twisting the facts completely around, they declared that our \u2018bands of assasins\u2019 had commenced \u2018a war of extermination against the peaceful workers of Coburg\u2019. At half-past one that day there was to be a \u2018great popular demonstration\u2019, at which it was hoped that the workers of the whole district would turn up. I was determined finally to crush this Red terror and so I summoned the Storm Detachment to meet at midday. Their number had now increased to 1,500. I decided to march with these men to the Coburg Festival and to cross the big square where the Red demonstration was to take place. I wanted to see if they would attempt to assault us again. When we entered the square we found that instead of the ten thousand that had been advertised, there were only a few hundred people present. As we approached they remained silent for the most part, and some ran away. Only at certain points along the route some bodies of Reds, who had arrived from outside the city and had not yet come to know us, attempted to start a row. But a few fisticuffs put them to flight. And now one could see how the population, which had for such a long time been so wretchedly intimidated, slowly woke up and recovered their courage. They welcomed us openly, and in the evening, on our return march, spontaneous shouts of jubilation broke out at several points along the route.\n\nAt the station the railway employees informed us all of a sudden that our train would not move. Thereupon I had some of the ringleaders told that if this were the case I would have all the Red Party heroes arrested that fell into our hands, that we would drive the train ourselves, but that we would take away with us, in the locomotive and tender and in some of the carriages, a few dozen members of this brotherhood of international solidarity. I did not omit to let those gentry know that if we had to conduct the train the journey would undoubtedly be a very risky adventure and that we might all break our necks. It would be a consolation, however, to know that we should not go to Eternity alone, but in equality and fraternity with the Red gentry.\n\nThereupon the train departed punctually and we arrived next morning in Munich safe and sound.\n\nThus at Coburg, for the first time since 1914, the equality of all citizens before the law was re-established. For even if some coxcomb of a higher official should assert to-day that the State protects the lives of its citizens, at least in those days it was not so. For at that time the citizens had to defend themselves against the representatives of the present State.\n\nAt first it was not possible fully to estimate the importance of the consequences which resulted from that day. The victorious Storm Troops had their confidence in themselves considerably reinforced and also their faith in the sagacity of their leaders. Our contemporaries began to pay us special attention and for the first time many recognized the National Socialist Movement as an organization that in all probability was destined to bring the Marxist folly to a deserving end.\n\nOnly the democrats lamented the fact that we had not the complaisance to allow our skulls to be cracked and that we had dared, in a democratic Republic, to hit back with fists and sticks at a brutal assault, rather than with pacifist chants.\n\nGenerally speaking, the bourgeois Press was partly distressed and partly vulgar, as always. Only a few decent newspapers expressed their satisfaction that at least in one locality the Marxist street bullies had been effectively dealt with.\n\nAnd in Coburg itself at least a part of the Marxist workers who must be looked upon as misled, learned from the blows of National Socialist fists that these workers were also fighting for ideals, because experience teaches that the human being fights only for something in which he believes and which he loves.\n\nThe Storm Detachment itself benefited most from the Coburg events. It grew so quickly in numbers that at the Party Congress in January 1923 six thousand men participated in the ceremony of consecrating the flags and the first companies were fully clad in their new uniform.\n\nOur experience in Coburg proved how essential it is to introduce one distinctive uniform for the Storm Detachment, not only for the purpose of strengthening the esprit de corps but also to avoid confusion and the danger of not recognizing the opponent in a squabble. Up to that time they had merely worn the armlet, but now the tunic and the well-known cap were added.\n\nBut the Coburg experience had also another important result. We now determined to break the Red Terror in all those localities where for many years it had prevented men of other views from holding their meetings. We were determined to restore the right of free assembly. From that time onwards we brought our battalions together in such places and little by little the red citadels of Bavaria, one after another, fell before the National Socialist propaganda. The Storm Troops became more and more adept at their job. They increasingly lost all semblance of an aimless and lifeless defence movement and came out into the light as an active militant organization, fighting for the establishment of a new German State.\n\nThis logical development continued until March 1923. Then an event occurred which made me divert the Movement from the course hitherto followed and introduce some changes in its outer formation.\n\nIn the first months of 1923 the French occupied the Ruhr district. The consequence of this was of great importance in the development of the Storm Detachment.\n\nIt is not yet possible, nor would it be in the interest of the nation, to write or speak openly and freely on the subject. I shall speak of it only as far as the matter has been dealt with in public discussions and thus brought to the knowledge of everybody.\n\nThe occupation of the Ruhr district, which did not come as a surprise to us, gave grounds for hoping that Germany would at last abandon its cowardly policy of submission and therewith give the defensive associations a definite task to fulfil. The Storm Detachment also, which now numbered several thousand of robust and vigorous young men, should not be excluded from this national service. During the spring and summer of 1923 it was transformed into a fighting military organization. It is to this reorganization that we must in great part attribute the later developments that took place during 1923, in so far as it affected our Movement.\n\nElsewhere I shall deal in broad outline with the development of events in 1923. Here I wish only to state that the transformation of the Storm Detachment at that time must have been detrimental to the interests of the Movement if the conditions that had motivated the change were not to be carried into effect, namely, the adoption of a policy of active resistance against France.\n\nThe events which took place at the close of 1923, terrible as they may appear at first sight, were almost a necessity if looked at from a higher standpoint; because, in view of the attitude taken by the Government of the German Reich, conversion of the Storm Troops into a military force would be meaningless and thus a transformation which would also be harmful to the Movement was ended at one stroke. At the same time it was made possible for us to reconstruct at the point where we had been diverted from the proper course.\n\nIn the year 1925 the German National Socialist Labour Party was re-founded and had to organize and train its Storm Detachment once again according to the principles I have laid down. It must return to the original idea and once more it must consider its most essential task to function as the instrument of defence and reinforcement in the spiritual struggle to establish the ideals of the Movement.\n\nThe Storm Detachment must not be allowed to sink to the level of something in the nature of a defence organization or a secret society. Steps must be taken rather to make it a vanguard of 100,000 men in the struggle for the National Socialist ideal which is based on the profound principle of a People\u2019s State."}, {"Title": "We No Speak Americano - Radio Edit", "Artist": "Yolanda Be Cool", "Lyrics": "Comme te po'*\nComme te po'\nComme te po' cap\u00ec chi te v\u00f2 bene\nSi tu le parle 'mmiezzo americano?\nQuando se fa l'ammore sotto 'a luna\nCome te vene 'capa e di: \"I love you!?\"\n\nPa pa l' americano\nPa pa l' americano\nPa pa l' americano\n\nFa l' americano!\n\nPa pa l' americano\nFa fa l' americano\n\nWhisky soda e rockenroll\nWhisky soda e rockenroll\nWhisky soda e rockenroll"}, {"Title": "Loca People (What the F**k!\") - Radio Edit", "Artist": "Sak Noel", "Lyrics": "All day, all night\nAll day, all night\nAll day, all night\nAll day, all night\nAll day, all night\nAll day, all night\nAll day, all night\nWhat the fuck?!\nWhat the...\nWhen I came to Spain and I saw people partying\nI thought to myself: \"What the fuck?!\"\nAll day, all night\nAll day, all night\n\"\u00a1Viva la fiesta!\n\u00a1Viva la noche!\n\u00a1Vivan los DJs!\"\nI couldn't believe what I was living\nSo I called my friend Johnny\nAnd I said to him:\n\"\u00a1Johnny, la gente est\u00e1 muy loca!\nWhat the fuck?!\n\u00a1Johnny, la gente est\u00e1 muy loca!\nWhat the fuck?!\"\n\nWhen I came to Spain and I saw people partying\nI thought to myself: \"What the fuck?!\"\nAll day, all night\nAll day, all night\n\"\u00a1Viva la fiesta!\n\u00a1Viva la noche!\n\u00a1Vivan los DJs!\"\nWhat the fuck?!

"Lyrics": "It was now lunch time and they were all sitting under the double green fly of the dining tent pretending that nothing had happened.\n\n\"Will you have lime juice or lemon squash?\" Macomber asked.\n\n\"I'll have a gimlet,\" Robert Wilson told him.\n\n\"I'II have a gimlet too. I need something,\" Macomber\u2019s wife said.\n\n\"I suppose it\u2019s the thing to do,\" Macomber agreed. \"Tell him to make three gimlets.\"\n\nThe mess boy had started them already, lifting the bottles out of the canvas cooling bags that sweated wet in the wind that blew through the trees that shaded the tents.\n\n\"What had I ought to give them?\" Macomber asked.\n\n\"A quid would be plenty,\" Wilson told him. \"You don\u2019t want to spoil them.\"\n\n\"Will the headman distribute it?\"\n\n\"Absolutely.\"\n\nFrancis Macomber had, half an hour before, been carried to his tent from the edge of the camp in triumph on the arms and shoulders of the cook, the personal boys, the skinner and the porters. The gun-bearers had taken no part in the demonstration. When the native boys put him down at the door of his tent, he had shaken all their hands, received their congratulations, and then gone into the tent and sat on the bed until his wife came in. She did not speak to him when she came in and he left the tent at once to wash his face and hands in the portable wash basin outside and go over to the dining tent to sit in a comfortable canvas chair in the breeze and the shade.\n\n\"You've got your lion,\" Robert Wilson said to him, \"and a damned fine one too.\"\n\nMrs. Macomber looked at Wilson quickly. She was an extremely handsome and well-kept woman of the beauty and social position which had, five years before, commanded five thousand dollars as the price of endorsing, with photographs, a beauty product which she had never used. She had been married to Francis Macomber for eleven years.\n\n\"He is a good lion, isn\u2019t he?\" Macomber said. His wife looked at him now. She looked at both these men as though she had never seen them before.\n\nOne, Wilson, the white hunter, she knew she had never truly seen before. He was about middle height with sandy hair, a stubby mustache, a very red face and extremely cold blue eyes with faint white wrinkles at the corners that grooved merrily when he smiled. He smiled at her now and she looked away from his face at the way his shoulders sloped in the loose tunic he wore with the four big cartridges held in loops where the left breast pocket should have been, at his big brown hands, his old slacks, his very dirty boots and back to his red face again. She noticed where the baked red of his face stopped in a white line that marked the circle left by his Stetson hat that hung now from one of the pegs of the tent pole.\n\n\"Well, here\u2019s to the lion,\" Robert Wilson said. He smiled at her again and, not smiling, she looked curiously at her husband.\n\nFrancis Macomber was very tall, very well built if you did not mind that length of bone, dark, his hair cropped like an oarsman, rather thin-lipped, and was considered handsome. He was dressed in the same sort of safari clothes that Wilson wore except that his were new, he was thirty-five years old, kept himself very fit, was good at court games, had a number of big-game fishing records, and had just shown himself, very publicly, to be a coward.\n\n\"Here\u2019s to the lion,\" he said. \"I can\u2019t ever thank you for what you did.\"\n\nMargaret, his wife, looked away from him and back to Wilson.\n\n\"Let\u2019s not talk about the lion,\" she said.\n\nWilson looked over at her without smiling and now she smiled at him.\n\n\"It\u2019s been a very strange day,\" she said. \"Hadn't you ought to put your hat on even under the canvas at noon? You told me that, you know.\"\n\n\"Might put it on,\" said Wilson.\n\n\"You know you have a very red face, Mr. Wilson,\" she told him and smiled again.\n\n\"Drink,\" said Wilson.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think so,\" she said. \"Francis drinks a great deal, but his face is never red.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s red today,\" Macomber tried a joke.\n\n\"No,\" said Margaret. \"It\u2019s mine that\u2019s red today. But Mr. Wilson\u2019s is always red.\"\n\n\"Must be racial,\" said Wilson. \"I say, you wouldn't like to drop my beauty as a topic, would you?\"\n\n\"I've just started on it.\"\n\n\"Let\u2019s chuck it,\" said Wilson.\n\n\"Conversation is going to be so difficult,\" Margaret said.\n\n\"Don\u2019t be silly, Margot,\" her husband said.\n\n\"No difficulty,\" Wilson said. \"Got a damn fine lion.\"\n\nMargot looked at them both and they both saw that she was going to cry. Wilson had seen it coming for a long time and he dreaded it. Macomber was past dreading it.\n\n\"I wish it hadn't happened. Oh, I wish it hadn't happened,\" she said and started for her tent. She made no noise of crying but they could see that her shoulders were shaking under the rose-colored, sun-proofed shirt she wore.\n\n\"Women upset,\" said Wilson to the tall man. \"Amounts to nothing. Strain on the nerves and one thing\u2019n another.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Macomber. \"I suppose that I rate that for the rest of my life now.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. Let\u2019s have a spot of the giant killer,\" said Wilson. \"Forget the whole thing. Nothing to it anyway.\"\n\n\"We might try,\" said Macomber. \"I won\u2019t forget what you did for me though.\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Wilson. \"All nonsense.\"\n\nSo they sat there in the shade where the camp was pitched under some wide-topped acacia trees with a boulder-strewn cliff behind them, and a stretch of grass that ran to the bank of a boulder-filled stream in front with forest beyond it, and drank their just-cool lime drinks and avoided one another\u2019s eyes while the boys set the table for lunch. Wilson could tell that the boys all knew about it now and when he saw Macomber\u2019s personal boy looking curiously at his master while he was putting dishes on the table he snapped at him in Swahili. The boy turned away with his face blank.\n\n\"What were you telling him?\" Macomber asked.\n\n\"Nothing. Told him to look alive or I\u2019d see he got about fifteen of the best.\"\n\n\"What\u2019s that? Lashes?\"\n\n\"It\u2019s quite illegal,\" Wilson said. \"You\u2019re supposed to fine them.\"\n\n\"Do you still have them whipped?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. They could raise a row if they chose to complain. But they don\u2019t. They prefer it to the fines.\"\n\n\"How strange!\" said Macomber.\n\n\"Not strange, really,\" Wilson said. \"Which would you rather do? Take a good birching or lose your pay?\"\n\nThen he felt embarrassed at asking it and before Macomber could answer he went on, \"We all take a beating every day, you know, one way or another.\"\n\nThis was no better. \"Good God,\" he thought. \"I am a diplomat, aren't I?\"\n\n\"Yes, we take a beating,\" said Macomber, still not looking at him. \"I\u2019m awfully sorry about that lion business. It doesn't have to go any further, does it? I mean no one will hear about it, will they?\"\n\n\"You mean will I tell it at the Mathaiga Club?\" Wilson looked at him now coldly. He had not expected this. So he\u2019s a bloody four-letter man as well as a bloody coward, he thought. I rather liked him too until today. But how is one to know about an American?\n\n\"No,\" said Wilson. \"I\u2019m a professional hunter. We never talk about our clients. You can be quite easy on that. It\u2019s supposed to be bad form to ask us not to talk though.\"\n\nHe had decided now that to break would be much easier. He would eat, then, by himself and could read a book with his meals. They would eat by themselves. He would see them through the safari on a very formal basis--what was it the French called it? Distinguished consideration--and it would be a damn sight easier than having to go through this emotional trash. He\u2019d insult him and make a good clean break. Then he could read a book with his meals and he\u2019d still be drinking their whisky. That was the phrase for it when a safari went bad. You ran into another white hunter and you asked, \"How is everything going?\" and he answered, \"Oh, I\u2019m still drinking their whisky,\" and you knew everything had gone to pot.\n\n\"I\u2019m sorry,\" Macomber said and looked at him with his American face that would stay adolescent until it became middle-aged, and Wilson noted his crew ropped hair, fine eyes only faintly shifty, good nose, thin lips and handsome jaw. \"I\u2019m sorry I didn't realize that. There are lots of things I don\u2019t know.\"\n\nSo what could he do, Wilson thought. He was all ready to break it off quickly and neatly and here the beggar was apologizing after he had just insulted him. He made one more attempt. \"Don\u2019t worry about me talking,\" he said. \"I have a living to make. You know in Africa no woman ever misses her lion and no white man ever bolts.\"\n\n\"I bolted like a rabbit,\" Macomber said.\n\nNow what in hell were you going to do about a man who talked like that, Wilson wondered.\n\nWilson looked at Macomber with his flat, blue, machine-gunner\u2019s eyes and the other smiled back at him. He had a pleasant smile if you did not notice how his eyes showed when he was hurt.\n\n\"Maybe I can fix it up on buffalo,\" he said. \"We\u2019re after them next, aren't we?\"\n\n\"In the morning if you like,\" Wilson told him. Perhaps he had been wrong. This was certainly the way to take it. You most certainly could not tell a damned thing about an American. He was all for Macomber again. If you could forget the morning. But, of course, you couldn't. The morning had been about as bad as they come.\n\n\"Here comes the Memsahib,\" he said. She was walking over from her tent looking refreshed and cheerful and quite lovely. She had a very perfect oval face, so perfect that you expected her to be stupid. But she wasn't stupid, Wilson thought, no, not stupid.\n\n\"How is the beautiful red-faced Mr. Wilson? Are you feeling better, Francis, my pearl?\"\n\n\"Oh, much,\" said Macomber.\n\n\"I've dropped the whole thing,\" she said, sitting down at the table. \"What importance is there to whether Francis is any good at killing lions? That\u2019s not his trade. That\u2019s Mr. Wilson\u2019s trade. Mr. Wilson is really very impressive killing anything. You do kill anything, don\u2019t you?\"\n\n\"Oh, anything,\" said Wilson. \"Simply anything.\" They are, he thought, the hardest in the world; the hardest, the cruelest, the most predatory and the most attractive and their men have softened or gone to pieces nervously as they have hardened. Or is it that they pick men they can handle? They can\u2019t know that much at the age they marry, he thought. He was grateful that he had gone through his education on American women before now because this was a very attractive one.\n\n\"We\u2019re going after buff in the morning,\" he told her.\n\n\"I\u2019m coming,\" she said.\n\n\"No, you\u2019re not.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I am. Mayn't I, Francis?\"\n\n\"Why not stay in camp?\"\n\n\"Not for anything,\" she said. \"I wouldn't miss something like today for anything.\"\n\nWhen she left, Wilson was thinking, when she went off to cry, she seemed a hell of a fine woman. She seemed to understand, to realize, to be hurt for him and for herself and to know how things really stood. She is away for twenty minutes and now she is back, simply enamelled in that American female cruelty. They are the damnedest women. Really the damnedest.\n\n\"We\u2019ll put on another show for you tomorrow,\" Francis Macomber said.\n\n\"You\u2019re not coming,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"You\u2019re very mistaken,\" she told him. \"And I want so to see you perform again. You were lovely this morning. That is if blowing things\u2019 heads off is lovely.\"\n\n\"Here\u2019s the lunch,\" said Wilson. \"You\u2019re very merry, aren't you?\"\n\n\"Why not? I didn't come out here to be dull.\"\n\n\"Well, it hasn't been dull,\" Wilson said. He could see the boulders in the river and the high bank beyond with the trees and he remembered the morning.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she said. \"It\u2019s been charming. And tomorrow. You don\u2019t know how I look forward to tomorrow.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s eland he\u2019s offering you,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"They\u2019re the big cowy things that jump like hares, aren't they?\"\n\n\"I suppose that describes them,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"It\u2019s very good meat,\" Macomber said.\n\n\"Did you shoot it, Francis?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"They\u2019re not dangerous, are they?\"\n\n\"Only if they fall on you,\" Wilson told her.\n\n\"I\u2019m so glad.\"\n\n\"Why not let up on the bitchery just a little, Margot,\" Macomber said, cutting the eland steak and putting some mashed potato, gravy and carrot on the down-turned fork that tined through the piece of meat.\n\n\"I suppose I could,\" she said, \"since you put it so prettily.\"\n\n\"Tonight we\u2019ll have champagne for the lion,\" Wilson said. \"It\u2019s a bit too hot at noon.\"\n\n\"Oh, the lion,\" Margot said. \"I\u2019d forgotten the lion!\"\n\nSo, Robert Wilson thought to himself, she is giving him a ride, isn't she? Or do you suppose that\u2019s her idea of putting up a good show? How should a woman act when she discovers her husband is a bloody coward? She\u2019s damn cruel but they\u2019re all cruel. They govern, of course, and to govern one has to be cruel sometimes. Still, I've seen enough of their damn terrorism.\n\n\"Have some more eland,\" he said to her politely.\n\nThat afternoon, late, Wilson and Macomber went out in the motor car with the native driver and the two gunbearers. Mrs. Macomber stayed in the camp. It was too hot to go out, she said, and she was going with them in the early morning. As they drove off Wilson saw her standing under the big tree, looking pretty rather than\nbeautiful in her faintly rosy khaki, her dark hair drawn back off her forehead and gathered in a knot low on her neck, her face as fresh, he thought, as though she were in England. She waved to them as the car went off through the swale of high grass and curved around through the trees into the small hills of orchard bush.\n\nIn the orchard bush they found a herd of impala, and leaving the car they stalked one old ram with long, widespread horns and Macomber killed it with a very creditable shot that knocked the buck down at a good two hundred yards and sent the herd off bounding wildly and leaping over one another\u2019s backs in long, leg-drawn-up leaps as unbelievable and as floating as those one makes sometimes in dreams.\n\n\"That was a good shot,\" Wilson said. \"They\u2019re a small target.\"\n\n\"Is it a worth-while head?\" Macomber asked.\n\n\"It\u2019s excellent,\" Wilson told him. \"You shoot like that and you\u2019ll have no trouble.\"\n\n\"Do you think we\u2019ll find buffalo tomorrow?\"\n\n\"There\u2019s a good chance of it. They feed out early in the morning and with luck we may catch them in the open.\"\n\n\"I\u2019d like to clear away that lion business,\" Macomber said. \"It\u2019s not very pleasant to have your wife see you do something like that.\"\n\nI should think it would be even more unpleasant to do it, Wilson thought, wife or no wife, or to talk about it having done it. But he said, \"I wouldn't think about that any more. Any one could be upset by his first lion. That\u2019s all over.\"\n\nBut that night after dinner and a whisky and soda by the fire before going to bed, as Francis Macomber lay on his cot with the mosquito bar over him and listened to the night noises it was not all over. It was neither all over nor was it beginning. It was there exactly as it happened with some parts of it indelibly emphasized and he was miserably ashamed at it. But more than shame he felt cold, hollow fear in him. The fear was still there like a cold slimy hollow in all the emptiness where once his confidence had been and it made him feel sick. It was still there with him now.\n\nIt had started the night before when he had wakened and heard the lion roaring somewhere up along the river. It was a deep sound and at the end there were sort of coughing grunts that made him seem just outside the tent, and when Francis Macomber woke in the night to hear it he was afraid. He could hear his wife breathing quietly, asleep. There was no one to tell he was afraid, nor to be afraid with him, and, lying alone, he did not know the Somali proverb that says a brave man is always frightened three times by a lion; when he first sees his track, when he first hears him roar and when he first confronts him. Then while they were eating breakfast by lantern light out in the dining tent, before the sun was up, the lion roared again and Francis thought he was just at the edge of camp.\n\n\"Sounds like an old-timer,\" Robert Wilson said, looking up from his kippers and coffee. \"Listen to him cough.\"\n\n\"Is he very close?\"\n\n\"A mile or so up the stream.\"\n\n\"Will we see him?\"\n\n\"We\u2019ll have a look.\"\n\n\"Does his roaring carry that far? It sounds as though he were right in camp.\"\n\n\"Carries a hell of a long way,\" said Robert Wilson. \"It\u2019s strange the way it carries. Hope he\u2019s a shootable cat. The boys said there was a very big one about here.\"\n\n\"If I get a shot, where should I hit him,\" Macomber asked, \"to stop him?\"\n\n\"In the shoulders,\" Wilson said. \"In the neck if you can make it. Shoot for bone. Break him down.\"\n\n\"I hope I can place it properly,\" Macomber said.\n\n\"You shoot very well,\" Wilson told him. \"Take your time. Make sure of him. The first one in is the one that counts.\"\n\n\"What range will it be?\"\n\n\"Can\u2019t tell. Lion has something to say about that. Don\u2019t shoot unless it\u2019s close enough so you can make sure.\"\n\n\"At under a hundred yards?\" Macomber asked.\n\nWilson looked at him quickly.\n\n\"Hundred\u2019s about right. Might have to take him a bit under. Shouldn't chance a shot at much over that. A hundred\u2019s a decent range. You can hit him wherever you want at that. Here comes the Memsahib.\"\n\n\"Good morning,\" she said. \"Are we going after that lion?\"\n\n\"As soon as you deal with your breakfast,\" Wilson said. \"How are you feeling?\"\n\n\"Marvellous,\" she said. \"I\u2019m very excited.\"\n\n\"I'll just go and see that everything is ready.\" Wilson went off. As he left the lion roared again.\n\n\"Noisy beggar,\" Wilson said. \"We\u2019ll put a stop to that.\"\n\n\"What\u2019s the matter, Francis?\" his wife asked him.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Macomber said.\n\n\"Yes, there is,\" she said. \"What are you upset about?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" he said.\n\n\"Tell me,\" she looked at him. \"Don\u2019t you feel well?\"\n\n\"It\u2019s that damned roaring,\" he said. \"It\u2019s been going on all night, you know.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you wake me,\" she said. \"I\u2019d love to have heard it.\"\n\n\"I've got to kill the damned thing,\" Macomber said, miserably.\n\n\"Well, that\u2019s what you\u2019re out here for, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes. But I\u2019m nervous. Hearing the thing roar gets on my nerves.\"\n\n\"Well then, as Wilson said, kill him and stop his roaring.\"\n\nYes, darling,\" said Francis Macomber. \"It sounds easy, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"You\u2019re not afraid, are you?\"\n\n\"Of course not. But I\u2019m nervous from hearing him roar all night.\"\n\n\"You\u2019ll kill him marvellously,\" she said. \"I know you will. I\u2019m awfully anxious to see it.\"\n\n\"Finish your breakfast and we\u2019ll be starting.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s not light yet,\" she said. \"This is a ridiculous hour.\"\n\nJust then the lion roared in a deep-chested moaning, suddenly guttural, ascending vibration that seemed to shake the air and ended in a sigh and a heavy, deep-chested grunt.\n\n\"He sounds almost here,\" Macomber\u2019s wife said.\n\n\"My God,\" said Macomber. \"I hate that damned noise.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s very impressive.\"\n\n\"Impressive. It\u2019s frightful.\"\n\nRobert Wilson came up then carrying his short, ugly, shockingly big-bored. 505 Gibbs and grinning.\n\n\"Come on,\" he said. \"Your gun-bearer has your Springfield and the big gun. Everything\u2019s in the car. Have you solids?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m ready,\" Mrs. Macomber said.\n\n\"Must make him stop that racket,\" Wilson said. \"You get in front. The Memsahib can sit back here with me.\"\n\nThey climbed into the motor car and, in the gray first daylight, moved off up the river through the trees. Macomber opened the breech of his rifle and saw he had metal-cased bullets, shut the bolt and put the rifle on safety. He saw his hand was trembling. He felt in his pocket for more cartridges and moved his fingers over the cartridges in the loops of his tunic front. He turned back to where Wilson sat in the rear seat of the doorless, box-bodied motor car beside his wife, them both grinning with excitement, and Wilson leaned forward and whispered,\n\n\"See the birds dropping. Means the old boy has left his kill.\"\n\nOn the far bank of the stream Macomber could see, above the trees, vultures circling and plummeting down.\n\n\"Chances are he\u2019ll come to drink along here,\" Wilson whispered.\n\n\"Before he goes to lay up. Keep an eye out.\"\n\nThey were driving slowly along the high bank of the stream which here cut deeply to its boulder-filled bed, and they wound in and out through big trees as they drove. Macomber was watching the opposite bank when he felt Wilson take hold of his arm. The car stopped.\n\n\"There he is,\" he heard the whisper. \"Ahead and to the right. Get out and take him. He\u2019s a marvellous lion.\"\n\nMacomber saw the lion now. He was standing almost broadside, his great head up and turned toward them. The early morning breeze that blew toward them was just stirring his dark mane, and the lion looked huge, silhouetted on the rise of bank in the gray morning light, his shoulders heavy, his barrel of a body bulking smoothly.\n\n\"How far is he?\" asked Macomber, raising his rifle.\n\n\"About seventy-five. Get out and take him.\"\n\n\"Why not shoot from where I am?\"\n\n\"You don\u2019t shoot them from cars,\" he heard Wilson saying in his ear.\n\n\"Get out. He\u2019s not going to stay there all day.\"\n\nMacomber stepped out of the curved opening at the side of the front seat, onto the step and down onto the ground. The lion still stood looking majestically and coolly toward this object that his eyes only showed in silhouette, bulking like some super-rhino. There was no man smell carried toward him and he watched the object, moving his great head a little from side to side. Then watching the object, not afraid, but hesitating before going down the bank to drink with such a thing opposite him, he saw a man figure detach itself from it and he turned his heavy head and swung away toward the cover of the trees as he heard a cracking crash and felt the slam of a. 30-06 220-grain solid bullet that bit his flank and ripped in sudden hot scalding nausea through his stomach. He trotted, heavy, big-footed, swinging wounded full-bellied, through the trees toward the tall grass and cover, and the crash came again to go past him ripping the air apart. Then it crashed again and he felt the blow as it hit his lower ribs and ripped on through, blood sudden hot and frothy in his mouth, and he galloped toward the high grass where he could crouch and not be seen and make them bring the crashing thing close enough so he could make a rush and get the man that held it.\n\nMacomber had not thought how the lion felt as he got out of the car. He only knew his hands were shaking and as he walked away from the car it was almost impossible for him to make his legs move. They were stiff in the thighs, but he could feel the muscles fluttering. He raised the rifle, sighted on the junction of the lion\u2019s head and shoulders and pulled the trigger. Nothing happened though he pulled until he thought his finger would break. Then\nhe knew he had the safety on and as he lowered the rifle to move the safety over he moved another frozen pace forward, and the lion seeing his silhouette flow clear of the silhouette of the car, turned and started off at a trot, and, as Macomber fired, he heard a whunk that meant that the bullet was home; but the lion kept on going. Macomber shot again and every one saw the bullet throw a spout of dirt beyond the trotting lion. He shot again, remembering to lower his aim, and they all heard the bullet hit, and the lion went into a gallop and was in the tall grass before he had the bolt pushed forward.\n\nMacomber stood there feeling sick at his stomach, his hands that held the Springfield still cocked, shaking, and his wife and Robert Wilson were standing by him. Beside him too were the two gun-bearers chattering in Wakamba.\n\n\"I hit him,\" Macomber said. \"I hit him twice.\"\n\n\"You gut-shot him and you hit him somewhere forward,\" Wilson said without enthusiasm. The gun-bearers looked very grave. They were silent now.\n\n\"You may have killed him,\" Wilson went on. \"We\u2019ll have to wait a while before we go in to find out.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Let him get sick before we follow him up.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Macomber.\n\n\"He\u2019s a hell of a fine lion,\" Wilson said cheerfully. \"He\u2019s gotten into a bad place though.\"\n\n\"Why is it bad?\"\n\n\"Can\u2019t see him until you\u2019re on him.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Macomber.\n\n\"Come on,\" said Wilson. \"The Memsahib can stay here in the car. We\u2019ll go to have a look at the blood spoor.\"\n\n\"Stay here, Margot,\" Macomber said to his wife. His mouth was very dry and it was hard for him to talk.\n\n\"Why?\" she asked.\n\n\"Wilson says to.\"\n\n\"We\u2019re going to have a look,\" Wilson said. \"You stay here. You can see even better from here.\"\n\n\"All right.\"\n\nWilson spoke in Swahili to the driver. He nodded and said, \"Yes, Bwana.\"\n\nThen they went down the steep bank and across the stream, climbing over and around the boulders and up the other bank, pulling up by some projecting roots, and along it until they found where the lion had been trotting when Macomber first shot. There was dark blood on the short grass that the gun-bearers pointed out with grass stems, and that ran away behind the river bank trees.\n\n\"What do we do?\" asked Macomber.\n\n\"Not much choice,\" said Wilson. \"We can\u2019t bring the car over. Bank\u2019s too steep. We\u2019ll let him stiffen up a bit and then you and I\u2019ll go in and have a look for him.\"\n\n\"Can\u2019t we set the grass on fire?\" Macomber asked.\n\n\"Too green.\"\n\n\"Can\u2019t we send beaters?\"\n\nWilson looked at him appraisingly. \"Of course we can,\" he said. \u2019;But it\u2019s just a touch murderous. You see, we know the lion\u2019s wounded. You can drive an unwounded lion--he\u2019ll move on ahead of a noise--but a wounded lion\u2019s going to charge. You can\u2019t see him until you\u2019re right on him. He\u2019ll make himself perfectly flat in cover you wouldn't think would hide a hare. You can\u2019t very well send boys in there to that sort of a show. Somebody bound to get mauled.\"\n\n\"What about the gun-bearers?\"\n\n\"Oh, they\u2019ll go with us. It\u2019s their shauri You see, they signed on for it. They don\u2019t look too happy though, do they?\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to go in there,\" said Macomber. It was out before he knew he\u2019d said it.\n\n\"Neither do I,\" said Wilson very cheerily. \"Really no choice though.\"\nThen, as an afterthought, he glanced at Macomber and saw suddenly how he was trembling and the pitiful look on his face.\n\n\"You don\u2019t have to go in, of course,\" he said. \"That\u2019s what I\u2019m hired for, you know. That\u2019s why I\u2019m so expensive.\"\n\n\"You mean you\u2019d go in by yourself? Why not leave him there?\"\n\nRobert Wilson, whose entire occupation had been with the lion and the problem he presented, and who had not been thinking about Macomber except to note that he was rather windy, suddenly felt as though he had opened the wrong door in a hotel and seen something shameful.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why not just leave him?\"\n\n\"You mean pretend to ourselves he hasn't been hit?\"\n\n\"No. Just drop it.\"\n\n\"It isn't done.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"For one thing, he\u2019s certain to be suffering. For another, some one else might run onto him.\"\n\n\"I see.\"\n\n\"But you don\u2019t have to have anything to do with it.\"\n\n\"I\u2019d like to,\" Macomber said. \"I\u2019m just scared, you know.\"\n\n\"I\u2019II go ahead when we go in,\" Wilson said, \"with Kongoni tracking. You keep behind me and a little to one side. Chances are we\u2019ll hear him growl. If we see him we\u2019ll both shoot. Don\u2019t worry about anything. I\u2019ll keep you backed up. As a matter of fact, you know, perhaps you\u2019d better not go. It might be much better. Why don\u2019t you go over and join the Memsahib while I just get it over with?\"\n\n\"No, I want to go.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Wilson. \"But don\u2019t go in if you don\u2019t want to. This is my shauri now, you know.\"\n\n\"I want to go,\" said Macomber.\n\nThey sat under a tree and smoked.\n\n\"Want to go back and speak to the Memsahib while we\u2019re waiting?\" Wilson asked.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I'll just step back and tell her to be patient.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Macomber. He sat there, sweating under his arms, his mouth dry, his stomach hollow feeling, wanting to find courage to tell Wilson to go on and finish off the lion without him. He could not know that Wilson was furious because he had not noticed the state he was in earlier and sent him back to his wife. While he sat there Wilson came up. \"I have your big gun,\" he said. \"Take it. We've given him time, I think. Come on.\"\n\nMacomber took the big gun and Wilson said:\n\n\"Keep behind me and about five yards to the right and do exactly as I tell you.\" Then he spoke in Swahili to the two gun-bearers who looked the picture of gloom.\n\n\"Let\u2019s go,\" he said.\n\n\"Could I have a drink of water?\" Macomber asked. Wilson spoke to the older gun-bearer, who wore a canteen on his belt, and the man unbuckled it, unscrewed the top and handed it to Macomber, who took it noticing how heavy it seemed and how hairy and shoddy the felt covering was in his hand. He raised it to drink and looked ahead at the high grass with the flat-topped trees behind it. A breeze was blowing toward them and the grass rippled gently in the wind. He looked at the gun-bearer and he could see the gun-bearer was suffering too with fear.\n\nThirty-five yards into the grass the big lion lay flattened out along the ground. His ears were back and his only movement was a slight twitching up and down of his long, black-tufted tail. He had turned at bay as soon as he had reached this cover and he was sick with the wound through his full belly, and weakening with the wound through his lungs that brought a thin foamy red to his mouth each time he breathed. His flanks were wet and hot and flies were on the little openings the solid bullets had made in his tawny hide, and his big yellow eyes, narrowed with hate, looked straight ahead, only blinking when the pain came as he breathed, and his claws dug in the soft baked earth. All of him, pain, sickness, hatred and all of his remaining strength, was tightening into an absolute concentration for a rush. He could hear the men talking and he waited, gathering all of himself into this preparation for a charge as soon as the men would come into the grass. As he heard their voices his tail stiffened to twitch up and down, and, as they came into the edge of the grass, he made a coughing grunt and charged.\n\nKongoni, the old gun-bearer, in the lead watching the blood spoor, Wilson watching the grass for any movement, his big gun ready, the second gun-bearer looking ahead and listening, Macomber close to Wilson, his rifle cocked, they had just moved into the grass when Macomber heard the blood-choked coughing grunt, and saw the swishing rush in the grass. The next thing he knew he was running; running wildly, in panic in the open, running toward the stream.\n\nHe heard the ca-ra-wong! of Wilson\u2019s big rifle, and again in a second crashing carawong! and turning saw the lion, horrible-looking now, with half his head seeming to be gone, crawling toward Wilson in the edge of the tall grass while the red-faced man worked the bolt on the short ugly rifle and aimed carefully as another blasting carawong! came from the muzzle, and the crawling, heavy, yellow bulk of the lion stiffened and the huge, mutilated head slid forward and Macomber, standing by himself in the clearing where he had run, holding a loaded rifle, while two\nblack men and a white man looked back at him in contempt, knew the lion was dead. He came toward Wilson, his tallness all seeming a naked reproach, and Wilson looked at him and said:\n\n\"Want to take pictures?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said.\n\nThat was all any one had said until they reached the motor car. Then Wilson had said:\n\n\"Hell of a fine lion. Boys will skin him out. We might as well stay here in the shade.\"\n\nMacomber\u2019s wife had not looked at him nor he at her and he had sat by her in the back seat with Wilson sitting in the front seat. Once he had reached over and taken his wife\u2019s hand without looking at her and she had removed her hand from his. Looking across the stream to where the gun-bearers were skinning out the lion he could see that she had been able to see the whole thing. While they sat there his wife had reached forward and put her hand on Wilson\u2019s shoulder. He turned and she had leaned forward over the low seat and kissed him on the mouth.\n\n\"Oh, I say,\" said Wilson, going redder than his natural baked color.\n\n\"Mr. Robert Wilson,\" she said. \"The beautiful red-faced Mr. Robert Wilson.\"\n\nThen she sat down beside Macomber again and looked away across the stream to where the lion lay, with uplifted, white-muscled, tendon-marked naked forearms, and white bloating belly, as the black men fleshed away the skin. Finally the gun-bearers brought the skin over, wet and heavy, and climbed in behind with it, rolling it up before they got in, and the motor car started. No one had said anything more until they were back in camp.\n\nThat was the story of the lion. Macomber did not know how the lion had felt before he started his rush, nor during it when the unbelievable smash of the .505 with a muzzle velocity of two tons had hit him in the mouth, nor what kept him coming after that, when the second ripping crash had smashed his hind quarters and he had come crawling on toward the crashing, blasting thing that had destroyed him. Wilson knew something about it and only expressed it by saying, \"Damned fine lion,\" but Macomber did not know how Wilson felt about things either. He did not know how his wife felt except that she was through with him.\n\nHis wife had been through with him before but it never lasted. He was very wealthy, and would be much wealthier, and he knew she would not leave him ever now. That was one of the few things that he really knew. He knew about that, about motor cycles--that was earliest--about motor cars, about duck-shooting, about fishing, trout, salmon and big-sea, about sex in books, many books, too many books, about all court games, about dogs, not much about horses, about hanging on to his money, about most of the other things his world dealt in, and about his wife not leaving him. His wife had been a great beauty and she was still a great beauty in Africa, but she was not a great enough beauty any more at home to be able to leave him and better herself and she knew it and he\nknew it. She had missed the chance to leave him and he knew it. If he had been better with women she would probably have started to worry about him getting another new, beautiful wife; but she knew too much about him to worry about him either. Also, he had always had a great tolerance which seemed the nicest thing about him if it were not the most sinister.\n\nAll in all they were known as a comparatively happily married couple, one of those whose disruption is often rumored but never occurs, and as the society columnist put it, they were adding more than a spice of adventure to their much envied and ever-enduring Romance by a Safari in what was known as Darkest Africa until the Martin Johnsons lighted it on so many silver screens where they were pursuing Old Simba the lion, the buffalo, Tembo the elephant and as well collecting specimens for the Museum of Natural History. This same columnist had reported them on the verge at least three times in the past and they had been. But they always made it up. They had a sound basis of union. Margot was too beautiful for Macomber to divorce her and Macomber had too much money for Margot ever to leave him.\n\nIt was now about three o\u2019clock in the morning and Francis Macomber, who had been asleep a little while after he had stopped thinking about the lion, wakened and then slept again, woke suddenly, frightened in a dream of the bloody-headed lion standing over him, and listening while his heart pounded, he realized that his wife was not in the other cot in the tent. He lay awake with that knowledge for two hours.\n\nAt the end of that time his wife came into the tent, lifted her mosquito bar and crawled cozily into bed.\n\n\"Where have you been?\" Macomber asked in the darkness.\n\n\"Hello,\" she said. \"Are you awake?\"\n\n\"Where have you been?\"\n\n\"I just went out to get a breath of air.\"\n\n\"You did, like hell.\"\n\n\"What do you want me to say, darling?\"\n\n\"Where have you been?\"\n\n\"Out to get a breath of air.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s a new name for it. You are a bitch.\"\n\n\"Well, you\u2019re a coward.\"\n\n\"All right,\" he said. \"What of it?\"\n\n\"Nothing as far as I\u2019m concerned. But please let\u2019s not talk, darling, because I\u2019m very sleepy.\"\n\n\"You think that I\u2019ll take anything.\"\n\n\"I know you will, sweet.\"\n\n\"Well, I won\u2019t.\"\n\n\"Please, darling, let\u2019s not talk. I\u2019m so very sleepy.\"\n\n\"There wasn't going to be any of that. You promised there wouldn't be.\"\n\n\"Well, there is now,\" she said sweetly.\n\n\"You said if we made this trip that there would be none of that. You promised.\"\n\n\"Yes, darling. That\u2019s the way I meant it to be. But the trip was spoiled yesterday. We don\u2019t have to talk about it, do we?\"\n\n\"You don\u2019t wait long when you have an advantage, do you?\"\n\n\"Please let\u2019s not talk. I\u2019m so sleepy, darling.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m going to talk.\"\n\n\"Don\u2019t mind me then, because I\u2019m going to sleep.\" And she did.\n\nAt breakfast they were all three at the table before daylight and Francis Macomber found that, of all the many men that he had hated, he hated Robert Wilson the most.\n\n\"Sleep well?\" Wilson asked in his throaty voice, filling a pipe.\n\n\"Did you?\"\n\n\"Topping,\" the white hunter told him.\n\nYou bastard, thought Macomber, you insolent bastard.\n\nSo she woke him when she came in, Wilson thought, looking at them both with his flat, cold eyes. Well, why doesn\u2019t he keep his wife where she belongs? What does he think I am, a bloody plaster saint? Let him keep her where she belongs. It\u2019s his own fault.\n\n\"Do you think we\u2019ll find buffalo?\" Margot asked, pushing away a dish of apricots.\n\n\"Chance of it,\" Wilson said and smiled at her. \"Why don\u2019t you stay in camp?\"\n\n\"Not for anything,\" she told him.\n\n\"Why not order her to stay in camp?\" Wilson said to Macomber.\n\n\"You order her,\" said Macomber coldly.\n\n\"Let\u2019s not have any ordering, nor,\" turning to Macomber, \"any silliness, Francis,\" Margot said quite pleasantly.\n\n\"Are you ready to start?\" Macomber asked.\n\n\"Any time,\" Wilson told him. \"Do you want the Memsahib to go?\"\n\n\"Does it make any difference whether I do or not?\"\n\nThe hell with it, thought Robert Wilson. The utter complete hell with it. So this is what it\u2019s going to be like. Well, this is what it\u2019s going to be like, then.\n\n\"Makes no difference,\" he said.\n\n\"You\u2019re sure you wouldn\u2019t like to stay in camp with her yourself and let me go out and hunt the buffalo?\" Macomber asked.\n\n\"Can\u2019t do that,\" said Wilson. \"Wouldn\u2019t talk rot if l were you.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m not talking rot. I\u2019m disgusted.\"\n\n\"Bad word, disgusted.\"\n\n\"Francis, will you please try to speak sensibly,\" his wife said.\n\n\"I speak too damned sensibly,\" Macomber said. \"Did you ever eat such filthy food?\"\n\n\"Something wrong with the food?\" asked Wilson quietly.\n\n\"No more than with everything else.\"\n\n\u2019Td pull yourself together, laddybuck,\" Wilson said very quietly. \"There\u2019s a boy waits at table that understands a little English.\"\n\n\"The hell with him.\"\n\nWilson stood up and puffing on his pipe strolled away, speaking a few words in Swahili to one of the gun-bearers who was standing waiting for him. Macomber and his wife sat on at the table. He was staring at his coffee cup.\n\n\"If you make a scene I\u2019ll leave you, darling,\" Margot said quietly.\n\n\"No, you won\u2019t.\"\n\n\"You can try it and see.\"\n\n\"You won\u2019t leave me.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"I won\u2019t leave you and you\u2019ll behave your self.\"\n\n\"Behave myself? That\u2019s a way to talk. Behave myself.\"\n\n\"Yes. Behave yourself.\"\n\n\"Why don\u2019t you try behaving?\"\n\n\"I\u2019ve tried it so long. So very long.\"\n\n\"I hate that red-faced swine,\" Macomber said. \"I loathe the sight of him.\"\n\n\"He\u2019s really very nice.\"\n\n\"Oh, shut up,\" Macomber almost shouted. Just then the car came up and stopped in front of the dining tent and the driver and the two gun-bearers got out. Wilson walked over and looked at the husband and wife sitting there at the table.\n\n\"Going shooting?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Macomber, standing up. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Better bring a woolly. It will be cool in the car,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"I\u2019II get my leather jacket,\" Margot said.\n\n\"The boy has it,\" Wilson told her. He climbed into the front with the driver and Francis Macomber and his wife sat, not speaking, in the back seat.\n\nHope the silly beggar doesn\u2019t take a notion to blow the back of my head off, Wilson thought to himself. Women are a nuisance on safari.\n\nThe car was grinding down to cross the river at a pebbly ford in the gray daylight and then climbed, angling up the steep bank, where Wilson had ordered a way shovelled out the day before so they could reach the parklike wooded rolling country on the far side.\n\nIt was a good morning, Wilson thought. There was a heavy dew and as the wheels went through the grass and low bushes he could smell the odor of the crushed fronds. It was an odor like verbena and he liked this early morning smell of the dew, the crushed bracken and the look of the tree trunks showing black through the early morning mist, as the car made its way through the untracked, parklike country. He had put the two in the back seat out of his mind now and was thinking about buffalo. The buffalo that he was after stayed in the daytime in a thick swamp where it was impossible to get a shot, but in the night they fed out into an open stretch of country and if he could come between them and their swamp with the car, Macomber would have a good chance at them in the open. He did not want to hunt buff with Macomber in thick cover. He did not want to hunt buff or anything else with Macomber at all, but he was a professional hunter and he had hunted with some rare ones in his time. If they got buff today there would only be rhino to come and the poor man would have gone through his dangerous game and things might pick up. He\u2019d have nothing more to do with the woman and Macomber would get over that too. He must have gone through plenty of that before by the look of things. Poor beggar. He must have a way of getting over it. Well, it was the poor sod\u2019s own bloody fault.\n\nHe, Robert Wilson, carried a double size cot on safari to accommodate any windfalls he might receive. He had hunted for a certain clientele, the international, fast, sporting set, where the women did not feel they were getting their money\u2019s worth unless they had shared that cot with the white hunter. He despised them when he was away from them although he liked some of them well enough at the time, but he made his living by them; and their\nstandards were his standards as long as they were hiring him.\n\nThey were his standards in all except the shooting. He had his own standards about the killing and they could live up to them or get some one else to hunt them. He knew, too, that they all respected him for this. This Macomber was an odd one though. Damned if he wasn\u2019t. Now the wife. Well, the wife. Yes, the wife. Hm, the wife. Well he\u2019d dropped all that. He looked around at them. Macomber sat grim and furious. Margot smiled at him. She looked younger today, more innocent and fresher and not so professionally beautiful. What\u2019s in her heart God knows, Wilson thought. She hadn\u2019t talked much last night. At that it was a pleasure to see her.\n\nThe motor car climbed up a slight rise and went on through the trees and then out into a grassy prairie-like opening and kept in the shelter of the trees along the edge, the driver going slowly and Wilson looking carefully out across the prairie and all along its far side. He stopped the car and studied the opening with his field glasses. Then he motioned to the driver to go on and the car moved slowly along, the driver avoiding warthog holes and driving around the mud castles ants had built. Then, looking across the opening, Wilson suddenly turned and said,\n\n\"By God, there they are!\"\n\nAnd looking where he pointed, while the car jumped forward and Wilson spoke in rapid Swahili to the driver, Macomber saw three huge, black animals looking almost cylindrical in their long heaviness, like big black tank cars, moving at a gallop across the far edge of the open prairie. They moved at a stiff-necked, stiff bodied gallop and he could see the upswept wide black horns on their heads as they galloped heads out; the heads not moving.\n\n\"They\u2019re three old bulls,\" Wilson said. \"We\u2019ll cut them off before they get to the swamp.\"\n\nThe car was going a wild forty-five miles an hour across the open and as Macomber watched, the buffalo got bigger and bigger until he could see the gray, hairless, scabby look of one huge bull and how his neck was a part of his shoulders and the shiny black of his horns as he galloped a little behind the others that were strung out in that steady plunging gait; and then, the car swaying as though it had just jumped a road, they drew up close and he could see the plunging hugeness of the bull, and the dust in his sparsely haired hide, the wide boss of horn and his outstretched, wide-nostrilled muzzle, and he was raising his rifle when Wilson shouted, \"Not from the car, you fool!\" and he had no fear, only hatred of Wilson, while the brakes clamped on and the car skidded, plowing sideways to an almost stop and Wilson was out on one side and he on the other, stumbling as his feet hit the still speeding-by of the earth, and then he was shooting at the bull as he moved away, hearing the bullets whunk into him, emptying his rifle at him as he moved steadily away, finally remembering to get his shots forward into the shoulder, and as he fumbled to re-load, he saw the bull was down. Down on his knees, his big head tossing, and seeing the other two still galloping he shot at the leader and hit him. He shot again and missed and he heard the carawonging roar as Wilson shot and saw the leading bull slide forward onto his nose.\n\n\"Get that other,\" Wilson said. \"Now you\u2019re shooting!\"\n\nBut the other bull was moving steadily at the same gallop and he missed, throwing a spout of dirt, and Wilson missed and the dust rose in a cloud and Wilson shouted, \"Come on. He\u2019s too far!\" and grabbed his arm and they were in the car again, Macomber and Wilson hanging on the sides and rocketing swayingly over the uneven ground, drawing up on the steady, plunging, heavy-necked, straight-moving gallop of the bull.\n\nThey were behind him and Macomber was filling his rifle, dropping shells onto the ground, jamming it, clearing the jam, then they were almost up with the bull when Wilson yelled \"Stop,\" and the car skidded so that it almost swung over and Macomber fell forward onto his feet, slammed his bolt forward and fired as far forward as he could aim into the galloping, rounded black back, aimed and shot again, then again, then again, and the bullets, all of them hitting, had no effect on the buffalo that he could see. Then Wilson shot, the roar deafening him, and he could see the bull stagger. Macomber shot again, aiming carefully, and down he came, onto his knees.\n\n\"All right,\" Wilson said. \"Nice work. That\u2019s the three.\"\n\nMacomber felt a drunken elation.\n\n\"How many times did you shoot?\" he asked.\n\n\"Just three,\" Wilson said. \"You killed the first bull. The biggest one. I helped you finish the other two. Afraid they might have got into cover. You had them killed. I was just mopping up a little. You shot damn well.\"\n\n\"Let\u2019s go to the car,\" said Macomber. \"I want a drink.\"\n\n\"Got to finish off that buff first,\" Wilson told him. The buffalo was on his knees and he jerked his head furiously and bellowed in pig-eyed, roaring rage as they came toward him.\n\n\"Watch he doesn\u2019t get up,\" Wilson said. Then, \"Get a little broadside and take him in the neck just behind the ear.\"\n\nMacomber aimed carefully at the center of the huge, jerking, rage-driven neck and shot. At the shot the head dropped forward.\n\n\"That does it,\" said Wilson. \"Got the spine. They\u2019re a hell of a looking thing, aren\u2019t they?\"\n\n\"Let\u2019s get the drink,\" said Macomber. In his life he had never felt so good.\n\nIn the car Macomber\u2019s wife sat very white-faced. \"You were marvellous, darling,\" she said to Macomber. \"What a ride.\"\n\n\"Was it rough?\" Wilson asked.\n\n\"It was frightful. I\u2019ve never been more frightened in my life.\"\n\n\"Let\u2019s all have a drink,\" Macomber said.\n\n\"By all means,\" said Wilson. \"Give it to the Memsahib.\" She drank the neat whisky from the flask and shuddered a little when she swallowed. She handed the flask to Macomber who handed it to Wilson.\n\n\"It was frightfully exciting,\" she said. \"It\u2019s given me a dreadful headache. I didn\u2019t know you were allowed to shoot them from cars though.\n\n\"No one shot from cars,\" said Wilson coldly.\n\n\"I mean chase them from cars.\"\n\n\"Wouldn\u2019t ordinarily,\" Wilson said. \"Seemed sporting enough to me though while we were doing it. Taking more chance driving that way across the plain full of holes and one thing and another than hunting on foot. Buffalo could have charged us each time we shot if he liked. Gave him every chance. Wouldn\u2019t mention it to anyone\nthough. It\u2019s illegal if that\u2019s what you mean.\"\n\n\"It seemed very unfair to me,\" Margot said, \"chasing those big helpless things in a motor car.\"\n\n\"Did it?\" said Wilson.\n\n\"What would happen if they heard about it in Nairobi?\"\n\n\"I'd lose my licence for one thing. Other unpleasantness,\" Wilson said, taking a drink from the flask. I'd be out of business.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Yes, really.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Macomber, and he smiled for the first time all day. \"Now she has something on you.\"\n\n\"You have such a pretty way of putting things, Francis,\" Margot Macomber said. Wilson looked at them both. If a four-letter man marries a five letter woman, he was thinking, what number of letters would their children be? What he said was, \"We lost a gun-bearer. Did you notice it?\"\n\n\"My God, no,\" Macomber said.\n\n\"Here he comes,\" Wilson said. \"He\u2019s all right. He must have fallen off when we left the first bull.\"\n\nApproaching them was the middle-aged gun-bearer, limping along in his knitted cap~ khaki tunic, shorts and rubber sandals, gloomy-faced and disgusted looking. As he came up he called out to Wilson in Swahili and they all saw the change in the white hunter\u2019s face.\n\n\"What does he say?\" asked Margot.\n\n\"He says the first bull got up and went into the bush,\" Wilson said with no expression in his voice.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Macomber blankly.\n\n\"Then it\u2019s going to be just like the lion,\" said Margot, full of anticipation.\n\n\"It\u2019s not going to be a damned bit like the lion,\" Wilson told her. \"Did you want another drink, Macomber?\"\n\n\"Thanks, yes,\" Macomber said. He expected the feeling he had had about the lion to come back but it did not. For the first time in his life he really felt wholly without fear. Instead of fear he had a feeling of definite elation.\n\n\"We\u2019ll go and have a look at the second bull,\" Wilson said. \"I\u2019II tell the driver to put the car in the shade.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" asked Margaret Macomber.\n\n\"Take a look at the buff,\" Wilson said.\n\n\"I\u2019II come.\"\n\n\"Come along.\"\n\nThe three of them walked over to where the second buffalo bulked blackly in the open, head forward on the grass, the massive horns swung wide.\n\n\"He\u2019s a very good head,\" Wilson said. \"That\u2019s close to a fifty-inch spread.\"\n\nMacomber was looking at him with delight.\n\n\"He\u2019s hateful looking,\" said Margot. \"Can\u2019t we go into the shade?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" Wilson said. \"Look,\" he said to Macomber, and pointed.\n\n\"See that patch of bush?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s where the first bull went in. The gun-bearer said when he fell off the bull was down. He was watching us helling along and the other two buff galloping. When he looked up there was the bull up and looking at him. Gun-bearer ran like hell and the bull went off slowly into that bush.\"\n\n\"Can we go in after him now?\" asked Macomber eagerly.\n\nWilson looked at him appraisingly. Damned if this isn\u2019t a strange one, he thought. Yesterday he\u2019s scared sick and today he\u2019s a ruddy fire eater.\n\n\"No,.we\u2019ll give him a while.\"\n\n\"Let\u2019s please go into the shade,\" Margot said. Her face was white and she looked ill.\n\nThey made their way to the car where it stood under a single, wide-spreading tree and all climbed in.\n\n\"Chances are he\u2019s dead in there,\" Wilson remarked. \"After a little we\u2019ll have a look.\"\n\nMacomber felt a wild unreasonable happiness that he had never known before.\n\n\"By God, that was a chase,\" he said. \"I\u2019ve never felt any such feeling. Wasn\u2019t it marvellous, Margot?\"\n\n\"I hated it.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I hated it,\" she said bitterly. \"I loathed it.\"\n\n\"You know I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever be afraid of anything again,\" Macomber said to Wilson. \"Something happened in me after we first saw the buff and started after him. Like a dam bursting. It was pure excitement.\"\n\n\"Cleans out your liver,\" said Wilson. \"Damn funny things happen to people.\"\n\nMacomber\u2019s face was shining. \"You know something did happen to me,\" he said. \"I feel absolutely different.\"\n\nHis wife said nothing and eyed him strangely. She was sitting far back in the seat and Macomber was sitting forward talking to Wilson who turned sideways talking over the back of the front seat.\n\n\"You know, I\u2019d like to try another lion,\" Macomber said. \u2019Tm really not afraid of them now. After all, what can they do to you?\"\n\n\"That\u2019s it,\" said Wilson. \"Worst one can do is kill you. How does it go? Shakespeare. Damned good. See if I can remember. Oh, damned good. Used to quote it to myself at one time. Let\u2019s see. \u2019By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once; we owe God a death and let it go which way it will, he that dies this year is quit for the next.\u2019 Damned fine, eh?\"\n\nHe was very embarrassed, having brought out this thing he had lived by, but he had seen men come of age before and it always moved him. It was not a matter of their twenty-first birthday.\n\nIt had taken a strange chance of hunting, a sudden precipitation into action without opportunity for worrying beforehand, to bring this about with Macomber, but regardless of how it had happened it had most certainly happened. Look at the beggar now, Wilson thought. It\u2019s that some of them stay little boys so long, Wilson thought. Sometimes all their lives.\n\nTheir figures stay boyish when they\u2019re fifty. The great American boy-men. Damned strange people. But he liked this Macomber now. Damned strange fellow. Probably meant the end of cuckoldry too. Well, that would be a damned good thing. Damned good thing. Beggar had probably been afraid all his life. Don\u2019t know what started it. But over now. Hadn\u2019t had time to be afraid with the buff. That and being angry too. Motor car too. Motor cars made it familiar. Be a damn fire eater now. He\u2019d seen it in the war work the same way. More of a change than any loss of virginity. Fear gone like an operation. Something else grew in its place. Main thing a man had. Made him into a man. Women knew it too. No bloody fear.\n\nFrom the far corner of the seat Margaret Macomber looked at the two of them. There was no change in Wilson. She saw Wilson as she had seen him the day before when she had first realized what his great talent was. But she saw the change in Francis Macomber now.\n\n\"Do you have that feeling of happiness about what\u2019s going to happen?\" Macomber asked, still exploring his new wealth.\n\n\"You\u2019re not supposed to mention it,\" Wilson said, looking in the other\u2019s face. \"Much more fashionable to say you\u2019re scared. Mind you, you\u2019ll be scared too, plenty of times.\"\n\n\"But you have a feeling of happiness about action to come?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Wilson. \"There\u2019s that. Doesn\u2019t do to talk too much about all this. Talk the whole thing away. No pleasure in anything if you mouth it up too much.\"\n\n\"You\u2019re both talking rot,\" said Margot. \"Just because you\u2019ve chased some helpless animals in a motor car you talk like heroes.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" said Wilson. \"I have been gassing too much.\" She\u2019s worried about it already, he thought.\n\n\"If you don\u2019t know what we\u2019re talking about why not keep out of it?\" Macomber asked his wife.\n\n\"You\u2019ve gotten awfully brave, awfully suddenly,\" his wife said contemptuously, but her contempt was not secure.\n\nShe was very afraid of something.\n\nMacomber laughed, a very natural hearty laugh. \"You know I have,\" he said. \"I really have.\"\n\n\"Isn\u2019t it sort of late?\" Margot said bitterly. Because she had done the best she could for many years back and the way they were together now was no one person\u2019s fault.\n\n\"Not for me,\" said Macomber.\n\nMargot said nothing but sat back in the corner of the seat.\n\n\"Do you think we\u2019ve given him time enough?\" Macomber asked Wilson cheerfully.\n\n\"We might have a look,\" Wilson said. \"Have you any solids left?\"\n\n\"The gun-bearer has some.\"\n\nWilson called in Swahili and the older gun-bearer, who was skinning out one of the heads, straightened up, pulled a box of solids out of his pocket and brought them over to Macomber, who filled his magazine and put the remaining shells in his pocket.\n\n\"You might as well shoot the Springfield,\" Wilson said. \"You\u2019re used to it. We\u2019ll leave the Mannlicher in the car with the Memsahib. Your gun-bearer can carry your heavy gun. I\u2019ve this damned cannon. Now let me tell you about them.\" He had saved this until the last because he did not want to worry Macomber. \"When a buff comes he comes with his head high and thrust straight out. The boss of the horns covers any sort of a brain shot. The only shot is straight into the nose. The only other shot is into his chest or, if you\u2019re to one side, into the neck or the shoulders. After they\u2019ve been hit once they take a hell of a lot of killing. Don\u2019t. try anything fancy. Take the easiest shot there is. They\u2019ve finished skinning out that head now. Should we get started?\"\n\nHe called to the gun-bearers, who came up wiping their hands, and the older one got into the back.\n\n\"I'll only take Kongoni,\" Wilson said. \"The other can watch to keep the birds away.\"\n\nAs the car moved slowly across the open space toward the island of brushy trees that ran in a tongue of foliage along a dry water course that cut the open swale, Macomber felt his heart pounding and his mouth was dry again, but it was excitement, not fear.\n\n\"Here\u2019s where he went in,\" Wilson said Then to the gun-bearer in Swahili, \"Take the blood spoor.\"\n\nThe car was parallel to the patch of bush. Macomber, Wilson and the gun-bearer got down. Macomber, looking back, saw his wife, with the rifle by her side, looking at him. He waved to her and she did not wave back.\n\nThe brush was very thick ahead and the ground was dry. The middle-aged gun-bearer was sweating heavily and Wilson had his hat down over his eyes and his red neck showed just ahead of Macomber. Suddenly the gunbearer said something in Swahili to Wilson and ran forward.\n\n\"He\u2019s dead in there,\" Wilson said. \"Good work,\" and he turned to grip Macomber\u2019s hand and as they shook hands, grinning at each other, the gun-bearer shouted wildly and they saw him coming out of the bush sideways, fast as a crab, and the bull coming, nose out, mouth tight closed, blood dripping, massive head straight out, coming in a charge, his little pig eyes bloodshot as he looked at them. Wilson, who was ahead, was kneeling shooting, and\nMacomber, as he fired, unhearing his shot in the roaring of Wilson\u2019s gun, saw fragments like slate burst from the huge boss of the horns, and the head jerked, he shot again at the wide nostrils and saw the horns jolt again and fragments fly, and he did not see Wilson now and, aiming carefully, shot again with the buffalo\u2019s huge bulk almost on him and his rifle almost level with the on-coming head, nose out, and he could see the little wicked eyes and the head started to lower and he felt a sudden white-hot, blinding flash explode inside his head and that was all he ever felt.\n\nWilson had ducked to one side to get in a shoulder shot. Macomber had stood solid and shot for the nose, shooting a touch high each time and hitting the heavy horns, splintering and chipping them like hitting a slate roof, and Mrs. Macomber, in the car, had shot at the buffalo with the 6.5 Mannlicher as it seemed about to gore Macomber and had hit her husband about two inches up and a little to one side of the base of his skull.\n\nFrancis Macomber lay now, face down, not two yards from where the buffalo lay on his side and his wife knelt over him with Wilson beside her.\n\n\"I wouldn\u2019t turn him over,\" Wilson said.\n\nThe woman was crying hysterically.\n\n\"I\u2019d get back in the car,\" Wilson said. \"Where\u2019s the rifle?\"\n\nShe shook her head, her face contorted. The gun-bearer picked up the rifle.\n\n\"Leave it as it is,\" said Wilson. Then, \"Go get Abdulla so that he may witness the manner of the accident.\"\n\nHe knelt down, took a handkerchief from his pocket, and spread it over Francis Macomber\u2019s crew-cropped head where it lay. The blood sank into the dry, loose earth.\n\nWilson stood up and saw the buffalo on his side, his legs out, his thinly-haired belly crawling with ticks. \"Hell of a good bull,\" his brain registered automatically. \"A good fifty inches, or better. Better.\" He called to the driver and told him to spread a blanket over the body and stay by it. Then he walked over to the motor car where the woman sat crying in the corner.\n\n\"That was a pretty thing to do,\" he said in a toneless voice. \"He would have left you too.\"\n\n\"Stop it,\" she said.\n\n\"Of course it\u2019s an accident,\" he said. \"I know that.\"\n\n\"Stop it,\" she said.\n\n\"Don\u2019t worry,\" he said. \"There will be a certain amount of unpleasantness but I will have some photographs taken that will be very useful at the inquest. There\u2019s the testimony of the gun-bearers and the driver too. You\u2019re perfectly all right.\"\n\n\"Stop it,\" she said.\n\n\"There\u2019s a hell of a lot to be done,\" he said. \"And I\u2019ll have to send a truck off to the lake to wireless for a plane to take the three of us into Nairobi. Why didn\u2019t you poison him? That\u2019s what they do in England.\"\n\n\"Stop it. Stop it. Stop it,\" the woman cried.\n\nWilson looked at her with his flat blue eyes.\n\n\"I\u2019m through now,\" he said. \"I was a little angry. I\u2019d begun to like your husband.\"\n\n\"Oh, please stop it,\" she said. \"Please stop it.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s better,\" Wilson said. \"Please is much better. Now I\u2019ll stop.\""}, {"Title": "Set Fire to the Rain", "Artist": "Adele", "Lyrics": "[Produced by Fraser T Smith]\n\n[Verse 1]\nI let it fall, my heart\nAnd as it fell, you rose to claim it\nIt

Way You Lie (Part II) - Pt. 2", "Artist": "Rihanna", "Lyrics": "Fifteen years ago, the American public was introduced to Marshall Mathers, Eminem, and Slim Shady, a triptych of manic personalities whose interests included raising hell, making enemies, and sticking nine-inch nails through each one of their eyelids. To commemorate Shady being set loose upon the world, we've decided to rank every single song Em has released to date\n\nBut first, allow us to qualify our countdown with a few rules of eligibility: We only included songs that were given an official retail release \u2014 that means tracks featured on studio albums, EPs, and compilations, plus guest verses; we didn't consult mixtapes or unofficial freestyles, so we offer our deepest apologies to \"Nail in the Coffin,\" \"Til Hell Freezes Over,\" and other noteworthy rarities. Skits weren't considered, either (condolences to all the Ken Kaniff and Steve Berman die-hards out there). Obviously, we only considered D12 tracks that featured a verse or hook from Eminem. And, finally, if there were multiple versions of a track, we opted to include the rendition we thought superior, so don't expect to see the live Grammy performance of \"Stan\" or The Slim Shady EP's \"Just the Two of Us.\" And with that, we begin the Eminem show...\n\n289. \"C'mon Let Me Ride\" (Skylar Grey feat.

Is he coming into these parts again?\n\nBOLETTE\nThat's why we want to have the flag up.\n\nBALLESTED\nWell, that's reasonable enough.\n\n(BOLETTE goes into the room again. A little after LYNGSTRAND enters from the road and stands still, interested by the easel and painting gear. He is a slender youth, poorly but carefully dressed, and looks delicate.)\n\nLYNGSTRAND\n(on the other side of the hedge). Good-morning.\n\nBALLESTED\n(turning round). Hallo! Good-morning. (Hoists up flag). That's it! Up goes the balloon. (Fastens the ropes, and then busies himself about the easel.) Good-morning, my dear sir. I really don't think I've the pleasure of\u2014Lyngstrand. I'm sure you're a painter.\n\nBALLESTED\nOf course I am. Why shouldn't I be?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nYes, I can see you are. May I take the liberty of coming in a moment?\n\nBALLESTED\nWould you like to come in and see?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nI should like to immensely.\n\nBALLESTED\nOh! there's nothing much to see yet. But come in. Come a little closer.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nMany thanks. (Comes in through the garden gate.)\n\nBALLESTED (painting)\nIt's the fjord there between the islands I'm working at.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nSo I see.\n\nBALLESTED\nBut the figure is still wanting. There's not a model to be got in this town.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nIs there to be a figure, too?\n\nBALLESTED\nYes. Here by the rocks in the foreground a mermaid is to lie, half-dead.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nWhy is she to be half-dead?\n\nBALLESTED\nShe has wandered hither from the sea, and can't find her way out again. And so, you see, she lies there dying in the brackish water.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nAh, I see.\n\nBALLESTED\nThe mistress of this house put it into my head to do something of the kind.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nWhat shall you call the picture when it's finished?\n\nBALLESTED\nI think of calling it \"The Mermaid's End.\"\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nThat's capital! You're sure to make something fine of it.\n\nBALLESTED\n(looking at him). In the profession too, perhaps?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nDo you mean a painter?\n\nBALLESTED\nYes.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nNo, I'm not that; but I'm going to be a sculptor. My name is Hans Lyngstrand.\n\nBALLESTED\nSo you're to be a sculptor? Yes, yes; the art of sculpture is a nice, pretty art in its way. I fancy I've seen you in the street once or twice. Have you been staying here long?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nNo; I've only been here a fortnight. But I shall try to stop till the end of the summer.\n\nBALLESTED\nFor the bathing?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nYes; I wanted to see if I could get a little stronger.\n\nBALLESTED\nNot delicate, surely?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nYes, perhaps I am a little delicate; but it's nothing dangerous. Just a little tightness on the chest.\n\nBALLESTED\nTush!\u2014a bagatelle! You should consult a good doctor.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nYes, I thought of speaking to Doctor Wangel one of these times.\n\nBALLESTED\nYou should. (Looks out to the left.) There's another steamer, crowded with passengers. It's really marvellous how travelling has increased here of late years.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nYes, there's a good deal of traffic here, I think.\n\nBALLESTED\nAnd lots of summer visitors come here too. I often hear our good town will lose its individuality with all these foreign goings on.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nWere you born in the town?\n\nBALLESTED\nNo; but I have accla\u2014acclimatised myself. I feel united to the place by the bonds of time and habit.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nThen you've lived here a long time?\n\nBALLESTED\nWell\u2014about seventeen or eighteen years. I came here with Skive's Dramatic Company. But then we got into difficulties, and so the company broke up and dispersed in all directions.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nBut you yourself remained here?\n\nBALLESTED\nI remained, and I've done very well. I was then working chiefly as decorative artist, don't you know.\n\n(BOLETTE comes out with a rocking-chair, which she places on the verandah.)\n\nBolette\n(speaking into the room). Hilde, see if you can find the embroidered footstool for father.\n\nLyngstrand\n(going up to the verandah, bows). Good-morning, Miss Wangel.\n\nBolette\n(by the balustrade). What! Is it you, Mr. Lyngstrand? Good-morning. Excuse me one moment, I'm only\u2014(Goes into room.)\n\nBALLESTED\nDo you know the family?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nNot well. I've only met the young ladies now and again in company; and I had a chat with Mrs. Wangel the last time we had music up at the \"View.\" She said I might come and see them.\n\nBALLESTED\nNow, do you know, you ought to cultivate their acquaintance.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nYes; I'd been thinking of paying a visit. Just a sort of call. If only I could find some excuse\u2014\n\nBALLESTED\nExcuse! Nonsense! (Looking out to the left.) Damn it! (Gathering his things.) The steamer's by the pier already. I must get off to the hotel. Perhaps some of the new arrivals may want me. For I'm a hairdresser, too, don't you know.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nYou are certainly very many-sided, sir.\n\nBALLESTED\nIn small towns one has to try to acclam\u2014acclimatise Oneself in various branches. If you should require anything in the hair line\u2014a little pomatum or such like\u2014you've only to ask for Dancing-master Ballested.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nDancing master!\n\nBALLESTED\nPresident of the \"Wind Band Society,\" by your leave. We've a concert on this evening up at the \"View.\" Goodbye, goodbye!\n\n(He goes out with his painting gear through the garden gate.\n\nHILDE comes out with the footstool. BOLETTE brings more flowers. LYNGSTRAND bows to HILDE from the garden below.)\n\nHilde (by the balustrade, not returning his bow). Bolette said you had ventured in today.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nYes; I took the liberty of coming in for a moment.\n\nHILDE\nHave you been out for a morning walk?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nOh, no! nothing came of the walk this morning.\n\nHILDE\nHave you been bathing, then?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nYes; I've been in the water a little while. I saw your mother down there. She was going into her bathing-machine.\n\nHILDE\nWho was?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nYour mother.\n\nHILDE\nOh! I see. (She puts the stool in front of the rocking-chair.)\n\nBOLETTE\n(interrupting). Didn't you see anything of father's boat out on the fjord?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nYes; I thought I saw a sailing-boat that was steering inland.\n\nBOLETTE\nI'm sure that was father. He's been to visit patients on the islands. (She is arranging things on the table.)\n\nLYNGSTRAND\n(taking a step up the stairs to the verandah). Why, how everything's decorated here with flowers!\n\nBOLETTE\nYes; doesn't it look nice?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nIt looks lovely! It looks as if it were some festival day in the house.\n\nHILDE\nThat's exactly what it is.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nI might have guessed it! I'm sure it's your father's birthday.\n\nBOLETTE (warningly to HILDE). Hm\u2014hm!\n\nHILDE\n(taking no notice of her). No, mother's.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nOh! Your mother's!\n\nBOLETTE\n(in low voice, angrily). Really, Hilde!\n\nHILDE\n(the same). Let me be! (To LYNGSTRAND.) I suppose you're going home to breakfast now?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\n(going down steps). Yes, I suppose I must go and get something to eat.\n\nHILDE\nI'm sure you find the living very good at the hotel!\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nI'm not staying at the hotel now. It was too expensive for me.\n\nHILDE\nWhere are you staying, then?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nI'm staying up at Mrs. Jensen's.\n\nHILDE\nWhat Mrs. Jensen's?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nThe midwife.\n\nHILDE\nExcuse me, Mr. Lyngstrand, but I really have other matters to attend to Lyngstrand. Oh! I'm sure I ought not to have said that.\n\nHILDE\nSaid what?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nWhat I said.\n\nHILDE\n(looking contemptuously at him). I don't understand you in the least.\n\nLYNGSTRAND. No, no. But I must say goodbye for the present.\n\nBOLETTE (comes forward to the steps). Good-bye, good-bye, Mr. Lyngstrand. You must excuse us now. But another day\u2014when you've plenty of time\u2014and inclination\u2014you really must come in and see father and the rest of us.\n\nLYNGSTRAND. Yes; thanks, very much. I shall be delighted. (Bows, and goes out through the garden gate. As he goes along the road he bows again towards the verandah.)\n\nHILDE\n(in low voice). Adieu, Monsieur! Please remember me to Mother Jensen.\n\nBOLETTE\n(in a low voice, shaking her arm). Hilde! You naughty child! Are you quite crazy? He might have heard you.\n\nHILDE\nPshaw! Do you think I care about that?\n\nBOLETTE\n(looking out to the right). Here's father!\n\n(WANGEL, in travelling dress and carrying a small bag, comes from the footpath.)\n\nWANGEL\nSee! I'm back again, little girls! (He enters through the garden gate.)\n\nBOLETTE\n(going towards him at the bottom of the garden). Oh! It is delightful that you've come!\n\nHILDE\n(also going up to him). Now have you got off for the whole day, father?\n\nWANGEL\nOh! no. I must go down to the office for a little while presently. I say\u2014do you know if Arnholm has come?\n\nBOLETTE\nYes; he arrived in the night. We sent to the hotel to enquire.\n\nWANGEL\nThen you've not seen him yet?\n\nBOLETTE\nNo; but he's sure to come here this morning.\n\nWANGEL\nYes; he's sure to do that.\n\nHILDE\n(pulling him). Father, now you must look round.\n\nWANGEL\n(looking towards the verandah). Yes, I see well enough, child. It's quite festive.\n\nBOLETTE\nNow, don't you think we've arranged it nicely?\n\nWANGEL\nI must say you have. Are\u2014are we alone at home now?\n\nHILDE\nYes; she's gone to\u2014\n\nBOLETTE\n(interrupting quickly). Mother has gone to bathe.\n\nWANGEL\n(looks lovingly at BOLETTE, and pats her head. Then he says, hesitating). Look here, little ones. Do you want to keep this up all day? And the flag hoisted, too?\n\nHILDE\nSurely you understand that, father!\n\nWANGEL\nHm! Yes; but you see\u2014\n\nBOLETTE\n(looks at him and nods). Surely you can understand we've been doing all this in honour of Mr. Arnholm. When such a good friend comes to see you for the first time\u2014\n\nHILDE\n(smiling, and shaking him). Think! he who used to be Bolette's tutor, father!\n\nWANGEL\n(with a half-smile). You're a pair of sly minxes. Well\u2014good heavens\u2014after all, it's but natural we should remember her who is no more with us. Here, Hilde (Gives her his bag), take that down to the office. No, children. I don't like this\u2014the way, I mean. This habit of every year\u2014well\u2014what can one say? I suppose it can't be managed any other way.\n\nHILDE\n(about to go out of garden, and, with the bag, stops short, turns, and points out). Look at that gentleman coming up here. I'm sure it's your tutor.\n\nBOLETTE\n(looks in that direction). He? (Laughs.) That is good! Do you think that middle-aged fellow is Arnholm?\n\nWANGEL\nWait a moment, child. Why, by Jove, I do believe it is he. Yes, it certainly is.\n\nBOLETTE\n(staring at him in quiet amazement). Yes; I almost think\u2014\n\n(ARNHOLM, in elegant morning dress, with gold spectacles, and a thin cane, comes along the road. He looks overworked. He looks in at the garden, bows in friendly fashion, and enters by the garden gate.)\n\nWANGEL\n(going to meet him). Welcome, dear Arnholm! Heartily welcome back to your old quarters again!\n\nARNHOLM\nThanks, thanks, Doctor Wangel. A thousand thanks. (They shake hands and walk up the garden together.) And there are the children! (Holds out his hands and looks at them.) I should hardly have known these two again.\n\nWANGEL\nNo, I believe you.\n\nARNHOLM\nAnd yet\u2014perhaps Bolette\u2014yes, I should have known Bolette again.\n\nWANGEL\nHardly, I think. Why, it is eight\u2014nine years since you saw her. Ah, yes! Many a thing has changed here meanwhile.\n\nARNHOLM\n(looking round). I really don't see it; except that the trees have grown remarkably, and that you've set up that arbour.\n\nWANGEL\nOh! no\u2014outwardly.\n\nARNHOLM\n(smiling). And then, of course, you've two grown-up daughters here now.\n\nWANGEL\nGrown up! Well, there's only one grown up.\n\nHILDE\n(aside). Just listen to father!\n\nWANGEL\nBut now let's sit down up there on the verandah. It's cooler than here. Won't you?\n\nARNHOLM\nThanks, thanks, dear doctor.\n\n(They go up. WANGEL motions him to the rocking-chair.)\n\nWANGEL\nThat's right! Now make yourself comfortable, and rest, for you seem rather tired after your journey.\n\nARNHOLM\nOh, that's nothing. Here, amid these surroundings Bolette (to WANGEL). Hadn't we better have some soda and syrup in the sitting-room? It's sure to be too hot out here soon.\n\nWANGEL\nYes, girls. Let's have some soda and syrup, and perhaps a drop of Cognac, too.\n\nBOLETTE\nCognac, too!\n\nWANGEL\nJust a little, in case anyone should like some.\n\nBOLETTE\nAll right. Hilde, go down to the office with the bag.\n\n(BOLETTE goes into the room, and closes the door after her.\n\nHILDE takes the bag, and goes through the garden to the back of the house.)\n\nARNHOLM\n(who has followed BOLETTE with his eyes). What a splendid\u2014. They are both splendid girls, who've grown up here for you.\n\nWANGEL\n(sitting down). Yes; you think so, too?\n\nARNHOLM\nWhy, it's simply amazing, how Bolette!\u2014and Hilde, too! But now, you yourself, dear doctor. Do you think of staying here all your life?\n\nWANGEL\nYes; I suppose so. Why, I've been born and bred here, so to say. I lived here so very happily with\u2014her who left us so early\u2014she whom you knew when you were here before, Arnholm.\n\nARNHOLM\nYes, yes!\n\nWANGEL\nAnd now I live here so happily with her who has taken her place. Ah! On the whole, fate has been very good to me.\n\nARNHOLM\nYou have no children by your second marriage? Wangel. We had a little boy, two\u2014two and a half years ago. But he didn't stay long. He died when he was four\u2014five months old.\n\nARNHOLM\nIsn't your wife at home today?\n\nWANGEL\nOh, yes. She's sure to be here soon. She's down there bathing. She does so every blessed day no matter what the weather.\n\nARNHOLM\nIs she ill, then?\n\nWANGEL\nNot exactly ill, although she has been extremely nervous for the last few years\u2014that is to say, she is now and then. I can't make out what really ails her. But to plunge into the sea is her joy and delight.\n\nARNHOLM\nYes; I remember that of old.\n\nWANGEL\n(with an almost imperceptible smile). To be sure! You knew Ellida when you were teacher out there at Skjoldviken.\n\nARNHOLM\nCertainly. She used often to visit at the Parsonage. But I mostly met her when I went to the lighthouse to see her father.\n\nWANGEL\nThose times out there, you may believe me, have set deep marks upon her. The people in the town here can't understand her at all. They call her the \"Lady from the Sea.\"\n\nARNHOLM\nDo they?\n\nWANGEL\nYes. And so\u2014now, you see, speak to her of the old days, dear Arnholm, it will do her good.\n\nARNHOLM\n(looks at him in doubt). Have you any reason for thinking so?\n\nWANGEL\nAssuredly I have.\n\nELLIDA\n(her voice is heard outside the garden). Are you there, Wangel?\n\nWANGEL\n(rising). Yes, dear.\n\n(Mrs. ELLIDA WANGEL, in a large, light wrap, and with wet hair hanging loose over her shoulders, comes from between the trees of the arbour. ARNHOLM rises.)\n\nWANGEL\n(smiling, and holding out his hands to her). Ah! So now we have our Mermaid!\n\nELLIDA\n(goes quickly up the verandah, and seizes his hands). Thank God that I see you again! When did you come?\n\nWANGEL\nJust now; a little while since. (Pointing to ARNHOLM.) But won't you greet an old acquaintance?\n\nELLIDA\n(holding out her hand to ARNHOLM). So here you are! Welcome! And forgive me for not being at home\u2014\n\nARNHOLM\nDon't mention it\u2014don't stand on any ceremony.\n\nWANGEL\nWas the water nice and fresh today?\n\nELLIDA\nFresh! Oh! The water here never is fresh. It is so tepid and lifeless. Ugh! The water in the fjord here is sick.\n\nARNHOLM\nSick?\n\nELLIDA\nYes, sick. And I believe it makes one sick, too.\n\nWANGEL\n(smiling). You're giving our bathing resort a good name!\n\nArnholm\nI should rather believe, Mrs. Wangel, that you have a peculiar relation to the sea, and to all that belongs to it.\n\nELLIDA\nPerhaps; I almost think so myself. But do you see how festively the girls have arranged everything in your honour?\n\nWANGEL\n(embarrassed). Hm! (Looks at his watch.) Well, I suppose I must be quick and\u2014\n\nARNHOLM\nIs it really for me?\n\nELLIDA\nYes. You may be sure we don't decorate like this every day. Ugh! How suffocatingly hot it is under this roof. (Goes down into the garden.) Come over here. Here at least there is a little air. (Sits down in arbour.)\n\nARNHOLM\n(going thither). I think the air quite fresh here.\n\nELLIDA\nYes, you\u2014who are used to the stifling air of the town! It's terrible there in the summer, I hear.\n\nWANGEL\n(who has also gone into the garden). Hm, dear Ellida, you must just entertain our friend alone for a little while.\n\nELLIDA\nAre you busy?\n\nWANGEL\nYes, I must go down to the office. And then I must change. But I won't be long.\n\nARNHOLM\n(sitting down in arbour). Now, don't hurry, dear doctor. Your wife and I will manage to kill the time.\n\nWANGEL\n(nodding). Oh, yes! I'm sure you will. Well, goodbye for the present. (He goes out through the garden.)\n\nELLIDA\n(after a short pause). Don't you think it's pleasant sitting out here?\n\nARNHOLM\nI think I've a pleasant seat now.\n\nELLIDA\nThey call this my arbour, because I had it fitted up, or rather Wangel did, for me.\n\nARNHOLM\nAnd you usually sit here?\n\nELLIDA\nYes, I pass most of the day here.\n\nARNHOLM\nWith the girls, I suppose?\n\nELLIDA\nNo, the girls\u2014usually sit on the verandah.\n\nARNHOLM\nAnd Wangel himself?\n\nELLIDA\nOh! Wangel goes to and fro\u2014now he comes to me, and then he goes to his children.\n\nArnholm\nAnd is it you who wish this?\n\nELLIDA\nI think all parties feel most comfortable in this way. You know we can talk across to one another\u2014if we happen to find there is anything to say.\n\nARNHOLM\n(after thinking awhile). When I last crossed your path\u2014out at Skjoldviken, I mean\u2014Hm! That is long ago now.\n\nELLIDA\nIt's quite ten years since you were there with us.\n\nARNHOLM\nYes, about that. But when I think of you out there in the lighthouse! The heathen, as the old clergyman called you, because your father had named you, as he said, after an old ship, and hadn't given you a name fit for a Christian.\n\nELLIDA\nWell, what then?\n\nARNHOLM\nThe last thing I should then have believed was that I should see you again down here as the wife of Wangel.\n\nELLIDA\nNo; at that time Wangel wasn't\u2014at that time the girls' first mother was still living. Their real mother, so Arnholm. Of course, of course! But even if that had not been-even if he had been free\u2014still, I could never have believed this would come about.\n\nELLIDA\nNor I. Never on earth\u2014then.\n\nARNHOLM\nWangel is such a good fellow. So honourable. So thoroughly good and kind to all men.\n\nELLIDA\n(warmly and heartily). Yes, he is indeed.\n\nARNHOLM\nBut he must be so absolutely different from you, I fancy.\n\nELLIDA\nYou are right there. So he is.\n\nARNHOLM\nWell, but how did it happen? How did it come about?\n\nELLIDA\nAh! dear Arnholm, you mustn't ask me about that. I couldn't explain it to you, and even if I could, you would never be able to understand, in the least.\n\nARNHOLM\nHm! (In lower tone.) Have you ever confided anything about me to your husband? Of course, I meant about the useless step\u2014I allowed myself to be moved to.\n\nELLIDA\nNo. You may be sure of that. I've not said a word to him about\u2014about what you speak of.\n\nARNHOLM\nI am glad. I felt rather awkward at the thought that\u2014\n\nELLIDA\nThere was no need. I have only told him what is true\u2014that I liked you very much, and that you were the truest and best friend I had out there.\n\nARNHOLM\nThanks for that. But tell me\u2014why did you never write to me after I had gone away?\n\nELLIDA\nI thought that perhaps it would pain you to hear from one who\u2014who could not respond as you desired. It seemed like re-opening a painful subject.\n\nARNHOLM\nHm. Yes, yes, perhaps you were right.\n\nELLIDA\nBut why didn't you write?\n\nARNHOLM\n(looks at her and smiles, half reproachfully). I make the first advance? Perhaps expose myself to the suspicion of wanting to begin all over again? After such a repulse as I had had?\n\nELLIDA\nOh no! I understand very well. Have you never since thought of forming any other tie?\n\nARNHOLM\nNever! I have been faithful to my first memories.\n\nELLIDA\n(half jestingly). Nonsense! Let the sad old memories alone. You'd better think of becoming a happy husband, I should say.\n\nARNHOLM\nI should have to be quick about it, then, Mrs. Wangel. Remember, I'm already\u2014I'm ashamed to say\u2014I'm past thirty-seven.\n\nELLIDA\nWell, all the more reason for being quick. (She is silent for a moment, and then says, earnestly, in a low voice.) But listen, dear Arnholm; now I am going to tell you something that I could not have told you then, to save my life.\n\nARNHOLM\nWhat is it?\n\nELLIDA\nWhen you took the\u2014the useless step you were just speaking of\u2014I could not answer you otherwise than I did.\n\nARNHOLM\nI know that you had nothing but friendship to give me; I know that well enough.\n\nELLIDA\nBut you did not know that all my mind and soul were then given elsewhere.\n\nARNHOLM\nAt that time!\n\nELLIDA\nYes.\n\nARNHOLM\nBut it is impossible. You are mistaken about the time. I hardly think you knew Wangel then.\n\nELLIDA\nIt is not Wangel of whom I speak.\n\nARNHOLM\nNot Wangel? But at that time, out there at Skjoldviken\u2014I can't remember a single person whom I can imagine the possibility of your caring for.\n\nELLIDA\nNo, no, I quite believe that; for it was all such bewildering madness\u2014all of it.\n\nARNHOLM\nBut tell me more of this.\n\nELLIDA\nOh! it's enough if you know I was bound then; and you know it now.\n\nARNHOLM\nAnd if you had not been bound?\n\nELLIDA\nWell?\n\nARNHOLM\nWould your answer to my letter have been different?\n\nELLIDA\nHow can I tell? When Wangel came the answer was different.\n\nARNHOLM\nWhat is your object, then, in telling me that you were bound?\n\nELLIDA\n(getting up, as if in fear and unrest). Because I must have someone in whom to confide. No, no; sit still.\n\nARNHOLM\nThen your husband knows nothing about this?\n\nELLIDA\nI confessed to him from the first that my thoughts had once been elsewhere. He never asked to know more, and we have never touched upon it since. Besides, at bottom it was simply madness. And then it was over directly\u2014that is to a certain extent.\n\nARNHOLM\n(rising). Only to a certain extent? Not quite?\n\nELLIDA\nYes, yes, it is! Oh, good heavens! Dear Arnholm, it is not what you think. It is something so absolutely incomprehensible, I don't know how I could tell it you. You would only think I was ill, or quite mad.\n\nARNHOLM\nMy dearest lady! Now you really must tell me all about it.\n\nELLIDA\nWell, then, I'll try to. How will you, as a sensible man, explain to yourself that\u2014(Looks round, and breaks off.) Wait a moment. Here's a visitor.\n\n(LYNGSTRAND comes along the road, and enters the garden. He has a flower in his button-hole, and carries a large, handsome bouquet done up in paper and silk ribbons. He stands somewhat hesitatingly and undecidedly by the verandah.)\n\nELLIDA\n(from the arbour). Have you come to see the girls, Mr. Lyngstrand?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\n(turning round). Ah, madam, are you there? (Bows, and comes nearer.) No, it's not that. It's not the young ladies. It's you yourself, Mrs.\n\nWANGEL\nYou know you gave me permission to come and see you Ellida. Of course I did. You are always welcome here.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nThanks; and as it falls out so luckily that it's a festival here today\u2014\n\nELLIDA\nOh! Do you know about that?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nRather! And so I should like to take the liberty of presenting this to Mrs. Wangel. (Bows, and offers her the bouquet.)\n\nELLIDA\n(smiling). But, my dear Mr. Lyngstrand, oughtn't you to give these lovely flowers to Mr. Arnholm himself? For you know it's really he Lyngstrand (looking uncertainly at both of them). Excuse me, but I don't know this gentleman. It's only\u2014I've only come about the birthday, Mrs. Wangel.\n\nELLIDA\nBirthday? You've made a mistake, Mr. Lyngstrand. There's no birthday here today.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\n(smiling slyly). Oh! I know all about that! But I didn't think it was to be kept so dark.\n\nELLIDA\nWhat do you know?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nThat it is Madam's birthday.\n\nELLIDA\nMine?\n\nARNHOLM\n(looks questioningly at her). Today? Surely not.\n\nELLIDA\n(to LYNGSTRAND). Whatever made you think that?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nIt was Miss Hilde who let it out. I just looked in here a little while ago, and I asked the young ladies why they were decorating the place like this, with flowers and flags.\n\nELLIDA\nWell?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nAnd so Miss Hilde said, \"Why, today is mother's birthday.\"\n\nELLIDA\nMother's!\u2014I see.\n\nARNHOLM\nAha! (He and ELLIDA exchange a meaning look.) Well, now that the young man knows about it\u2014\n\nELLIDA\n(to LYNGSTRAND). Well, now that you know\u2014\n\nLYNGSTRAND\n(offering her the bouquet again). May I take the liberty of congratulating you?\n\nELLIDA\n(taking the flowers). My best thanks. Won't you sit down a moment, Mr. Lyngstrand? (ELLIDA, ARNHOLM, and LYNGSTRAND sit down in the arbour.) This\u2014birthday business\u2014was to have been kept secret, Mr. Arnholm.\n\nARNHOLM\nSo I see. It wasn't for us uninitiated folk!\n\nELLIDA\n(putting down the bouquet). Just so. Not for the uninitiated.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\n'Pon my word, I won't tell a living soul about it.\n\nELLIDA\nOh, it wasn't meant like that. But how are you getting on? I think you look better than you did.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nOh! I think I'm getting on famously. And by next year, if I can go south\u2014\n\nELLIDA\nAnd you are going south, the girls tell me.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nYes, for I've a benefactor and friend at Bergen, who looks after me, and has promised to help me next year.\n\nELLIDA\nHow did you get such a friend?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nWell, it all happened so very luckily. I once went to sea in one of his ships.\n\nELLIDA\nDid you? So you wanted to go to sea?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nNo, not at all. But when mother died, father wouldn't have me knocking about at home any longer, and so he sent me to sea. Then we were wrecked in the English Channel on our way home; and that was very fortunate for me.\n\nARNHOLM\nWhat do you mean?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nYes, for it was in the shipwreck that I got this little weakness\u2014of my chest. I was so long in the ice-cold water before they picked me up; and so I had to give up the sea. Yes, that was very fortunate.\n\nARNHOLM\nIndeed! Do you think so?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nYes, for the weakness isn't dangerous; and now I can be a sculptor, as I so dearly want to be. Just think; to model in that delicious clay, that yields so caressingly to your fingers!\n\nELLIDA\nAnd what are you going to model? Is it to be mermen and mermaids? Or is it to be old Vikings?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nNo, not that. As soon as I can set about it, I am going to try if I can produce a great work\u2014a group, as they call it.\n\nELLIDA\nYes; but what's the group to be?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nOh! something I've experienced myself.\n\nARNHOLM\nYes, yes; always stick to that.\n\nELLIDA\nBut what's it to be?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nWell, I thought it should be the young wife of a sailor, who lies sleeping in strange unrest, and she is dreaming. I fancy I shall do it so that you will see she is dreaming.\n\nARNHOLM\nIs there anything else?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nYes, there's to be another figure\u2014a sort of apparition, as they say. It's her husband, to whom she has been faithless while he was away, and he is drowned at sea.\n\nARNHOLM\nWhat?\n\nELLIDA\nDrowned?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nYes, he was drowned on a sea voyage. But that's the wonderful part of it\u2014he comes home all the same. It is night-time. And he is standing by her bed looking at her. He is to stand there dripping wet, like one drawn from the sea.\n\nELLIDA\n(leaning back in her chair). What an extraordinary idea! (Shutting her eyes.) Oh! I can see it so clearly, living before me!\n\nARNHOLM\nBut how on earth, Mr.\u2014Mr.\u2014I thought you said it was to be something you had experienced.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nYes. I did experience that\u2014that is to say, to a certain extent.\n\nARNHOLM\nYou saw a dead man?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nWell, I don't mean I've actually seen this\u2014experienced it in the flesh. But still\u2014\n\nELLIDA\n(quickly, intently). Oh! tell me all you can about it! I must understand about all this.\n\nARNHOLM\n(smiling). Yes, that'll be quite in your line. Something that has to do with sea fancies.\n\nELLIDA\nWhat was it, Mr. Lyngstrand?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nWell, it was like this. At the time when we were to sail home in the brig from a town they called Halifax, we had to leave the boatswain behind in the hospital. So we had to engage an American instead. This new boatswain Ellida. The American?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nYes, one day he got the captain to lend him a lot of old newspapers and he was always reading them. For he wanted to teach himself Norwegian, he said.\n\nELLIDA\nWell, and then?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nIt was one evening in rough weather. All hands were on deck\u2014except the boatswain and myself. For he had sprained his foot and couldn't walk, and I was feeling rather low, and was lying in my berth. Well, he was sitting there in the forecastle, reading one of those old papers again.\n\nELLIDA\nWell, well!\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nBut just as he was sitting there quietly reading, I heard him utter a sort of yell. And when I looked at him, I saw his face was as white as chalk. And then he began to crush and crumple the paper, and to tear it into a thousand shreds. But he did it so quietly, quietly.\n\nELLIDA\nDidn't he say anything? Didn't he speak?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nNot directly; but a little after he said to himself, as it were: \"Married\u2014to another man. While I was away.\"\n\nELLIDA\n(closes her eyes, and says, half to herself). He said that?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nYes. And think\u2014he said it in perfect Norwegian. That man must have learnt foreign languages very easily\u2014\n\nELLIDA\nAnd what then? What else happened?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nWell, now the remarkable part is coming\u2014that I shall never forget as long as I live. For he added, and that quite quietly, too: \"But she is mine, and mine she shall remain. And she shall follow me, if I should come home and fetch her, as a drowned man from the dark sea.\"\n\nELLIDA\n(pouring herself out a glass of water. Her hand trembles). Ah! How close it is here today.\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nAnd he said this with such strength of will that I thought he must be the man to do it.\n\nELLIDA\nDon't you know anything about\u2014what became of the man?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nOh! madam, he's certainly not living now.\n\nELLIDA(quickly). Why do you think that?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nWhy? Because we were shipwrecked afterwards in the Channel. I had got into the longboat with the captain and five others. The mate got into the stern-boat; and the American was in that too, and another man.\n\nELLIDA\nAnd nothing has been heard of them since?\n\nLYNGSTRAND\nNot a word. The friend who looks after me said so quite recently in a letter. But it's just because of this I was so anxious to make it into a work of art. I see the faithless sailor-wife so life-like before me, and the avenger who is drowned, and who nevertheless comes home from the sea. I can see them both so distinctly.\n\nELLIDA\nI, too. (Rises.) Come; let us go in\u2014or, rather, go down to Wangel. I think it is so suffocatingly hot. (She goes out of the arbour.)\n\nLYNGSTRAND\n(who has also risen). I, for my part, must ask you to excuse me. This was only to be a short visit because of the birthday.\n\nELLIDA. As you wish. (Holds out her hand to him.) Goodbye, and thank you for the flowers.\n\n(LYNGSTRAND bows, and goes off through the garden gate.)\n\nARNHOLM\n(rises, and goes up to ELLIDA). I see well enough that this has gone to your heart, Mrs. Wangel.\n\nELLIDA\nYes; you may well say so. Although Arnholm. But still\u2014after all, it's no more than you were bound to expect.\n\nELLIDA\n(looks at him surprised). Expect!\n\nARNHOLM\nWell, so it seems to me.\n\nELLIDA\nExpect that anyone should come back again!\u2014come to life again like that!\n\nARNHOLM\nBut what on earth!\u2014is it that mad sculptor's sea story, then?\n\nELLIDA\nOh, dear Arnholm, perhaps it isn't so mad after all!\n\nARNHOLM\nIs it that nonsense about the dead man that has moved you so? And I who thought that\u2014\n\nELLIDA\nWhat did you think?\n\nARNHOLM\nI naturally thought that was only a make-believe of yours. And that you were sitting here grieving because you had found out a family feast was being kept secret; because your husband and his children live a life of remembrances in which you have no part.\n\nELLIDA\nOh! no, no! That may be as it may. I have no right to claim my husband wholly and solely for myself.\n\nARNHOLM\nI should say you had.\n\nELLIDA\nYes. Yet, all the same, I have not. That is it. Why, I, too, live in something from which they are shut out.\n\nARNHOLM\nYou! (In lower tone.) Do you mean?\u2014you, you do not really love your husband!\n\nELLIDA\nOh! yes, yes! I have learnt to love him with all my heart! And that's why it is so terrible-so inexplicable\u2014so absolutely inconceivable!\n\nARNHOLM\nNow you must and shall confide all your troubles to me. Will you, Mrs. Wangel?\n\nELLIDA\nI cannot, dear friend. Not now, in any case. Later, perhaps.\n\n(BOLETTE comes out into the verandah, and goes down into the garden.)\n\nBOLETTE\nFather's coming up from the office. Hadn't we better all of us go into the sitting-room?\n\nELLIDA\nYes, let us.\n\n(WANGEL, in other clothes, comes with HILDE from behind the house.)\n\nWANGEL\nNow, then, here I am at your service. And now we shall enjoy a good glass of something cool.\n\nELLIDA\nWait a moment. (She goes into the arbour and fetches the bouquet.)\n\nHILDE\nI say! All those lovely flowers! Where did you get them?\n\nELLIDA\nFrom the sculptor, Lyngstrand, my dear Hilde.\n\nHILDE\n(starts). From Lyngstrand?\n\nBOLETTE\n(uneasily). Has Lyngstrand been here again?\n\nELLIDA\n(with a half-smile). Yes. He came here with these. Because of the birthday, you understand.\n\nBOLETTE\n(looks at HILDE). Oh!\n\nHILDE\n(mutters). The idiot!\n\nWANGEL\n(in painful confusion to ELLIDA). Hm!\u2014yes, well you see-I must tell you, my dear, good, beloved Ellida\u2014\n\nELLIDA\n(interrupting). Come, girls! Let us go and put my flowers in the water together with the others. (Goes up to the verandah.)\n\nBOLETTE\n(to HILDE). Oh! After all she is good at heart.\n\nHILDE\n(in a low tone with angry look). Fiddlesticks! She only does it to take in father.\n\nWANGEL\n(on the verandah, presses ELLIDA'S hand). Thanks-thanks! My heartfelt thanks for that, dear Ellida.\n\nELLIDA\n(arranging the flowers). Nonsense! Should not I, too, be in it, and take part in\u2014in mother's birthday?\n\nARNHOLM\nHm!\n\n(He goes up to WANGEL, and ELLIDA, BOLETTE, and HILDE remain in the garden below.)"}, {"Title": "Lonely", "Artist": "Various Artists", "Lyrics": "1/1\nAha Gazelle - 180 - 7/7\nFMLYBND - FMLYBND - 10/10\nLil Darkie - THIS DOES NOT EXIST - 13/13\nLil Jairmy - Can\u2019t Rush the Vibe - 19/19\nMANNY S\u00c1NCHEZ - Cutest Spic Alive - 6/6\nNightmares - After Death - 4/10\nParteum - MMXX - 3/3\nTeejayx6 - 2020 - EP - 5/5\nTheHxliday - Broken Halls - EP - 5/5\nwolfi - White - 12/12\n\n1/2\nCask - Surviving on Borrowed Time - 12/12\nFamous Dex - DEXTER 2031 - 2/6\nIdaly - Jungle - 4/8\nParteum - Addendum - 4/4\n\n1/3\nDavid Bisbal - En Tus Planes - 13/13\nJUNG - Dreamers - 10/10\nRAT BOY - GOVERNMENT VACATION - 6/6\nSalaam Remi - Do It FoR ThE CulTuRe 2 - 10/25\nUlises Bueno - Ahora - 0/15\n\n1/4\nYL Stunna - Raised on Cleveland - 2/16\n\n1/5\nYFG Rush - Antes do Rush!

She had wrapped her marble-like body in a huge fur, and rolled herself up trembling like a cat.\n\n\"I don't understand it,\" I exclaimed, \"It isn't really cold any\nlonger. For two weeks past we have had perfect spring weather. You must be nervous.\"\n\n\"Much obliged for your spring,\" she replied with a low stony voice, and immediately afterwards sneezed divinely, twice in succession. \"I really can't stand it here much longer, and I am beginning to understand--\"\n\n\"What, dear lady?\"\n\n\"I am beginning to believe the unbelievable and to understand the un-understandable. All of a sudden I understand the Germanic virtue of woman, and German philosophy, and I am no longer surprised that you of the North do not know how to love, haven't even an idea of what love is.\"\n\n\"But, madame,\" I replied flaring up, \"I surely haven't given you any reason.\"\n\n\"Oh, you--\" The divinity sneezed for the third time, and shrugged her shoulders with inimitable grace. \"That's why I have always been nice to you, and even come to see you now and then, although I catch a cold every time, in spite of all my furs. Do you remember the first time we met?\"\n\n\"How could I forget it,\" I said. \"You wore your abundant hair in\nbrown curls, and you had brown eyes and a red mouth, but I recognized you immediately by the outline of your face and its marble-like pallor--you always wore a violet-blue velvet jacket edged with squirrel-skin.\"\n\n\"You were really in love with the costume, and awfully docile.\"\n\n\"You have taught me what love is. Your serene form of worship let me forget two thousand years.\"\n\n\"And my faithfulness to you was without equal!\"\n\n\"Well, as far as faithfulness goes--\"\n\n\"Ungrateful!\"\n\n\"I will not reproach you with anything. You are a divine woman, but nevertheless a woman, and like every woman cruel in love.\"\n\n\"What you call cruel,\" the goddess of love replied eagerly, \"is\nsimply the element of passion and of natural love, which is woman's nature and makes her give herself where she loves, and makes her love everything, that pleases her.\"\n\n\"Can there be any greater cruelty for a lover than the\nunfaithfulness of the woman he loves?\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" she replied. \"We are faithful as long as we love, but you demand faithfulness of a woman without love, and the giving of herself without enjoyment. Who is cruel there--woman or man? You of\nthe North in general take love too soberly and seriously. You talk\nof duties where there should be only a question of pleasure.\"\n\n\"That is why our emotions are honorable and virtuous, and our\nrelations permanent.\"\n\n\"And yet a restless, always unsatisfied craving for the nudity of\npaganism,\" she interrupted, \"but that love, which is the highest joy,\nwhich is divine simplicity itself, is not for you moderns, you\nchildren of reflection. It works only evil in you. _As soon as you\nwish to be natural, you become common._ To you nature seems something\nhostile; you have made devils out of the smiling gods of Greece, and\nout of me a demon. You can only exorcise and curse me, or slay\nyourselves in bacchantic madness before my altar. And if ever one of\nyou has had the courage to kiss my red mouth, he makes a barefoot\npilgrimage to Rome in penitential robes and expects flowers to grow\nfrom his withered staff, while under my feet roses, violets, and\nmyrtles spring up every hour, but their fragrance does not agree with\nyou. Stay among your northern fogs and Christian incense; let us\npagans remain under the debris, beneath the lava; do not disinter us.\nPompeii was not built for you, nor our villas, our baths, our temples.\nYou do not require gods. We are chilled in your world.\"\n\nThe beautiful marble woman coughed, and drew the dark sables still\ncloser about her shoulders.\n\n\"Much obliged for the classical lesson,\" I replied, \"but you cannot\ndeny, that man and woman are mortal enemies, in your serene sunlit\nworld as well as in our foggy one. In love there is union into a\nsingle being for a short time only, capable of only one thought, one\nsensation, one will, in order to be then further disunited. And you\nknow this better than I; whichever of the two fails to subjugate will\nsoon feel the feet of the other on his neck--\"\n\n\"And as a rule the man that of the woman,\" cried Madame Venus with\nproud mockery, \"which you know better than I.\"\n\n\"Of course, and that is why I don't have any illusions.\"\n\n\"You mean you are now my slave without illusions, and for that\nreason you shall feel the weight of my foot without mercy.\"\n\n\"Madame!\"\n\n\"Don't you know me yet? Yes, I am _cruel_--since you take so much\ndelight in that word-and am I not entitled to be so? Man is the one\nwho desires, woman the one who is desired. This is woman's entire but\ndecisive advantage. Through his passion nature has given man into\nwoman's hands, and the woman who does not know how to make him her\nsubject, her slave, her toy, and how to betray him with a smile in the\nend is not wise.\"\n\n\"Exactly your principles,\" I interrupted angrily.\n\n\"They are based on the experience of thousands of years,\" she\nreplied ironically, while her white fingers played over the dark fur.\n\"The more devoted a woman shows herself, the sooner the man sobers\ndown and becomes domineering. The more cruelly she treats him and the\nmore faithless she is, the worse she uses him, the more wantonly she\nplays with him, the less pity she shows him, by so much the more will\nshe increase his desire, be loved, worshipped by him. So it has\nalways been, since the time of Helen and Delilah, down to Catherine\nthe Second and Lola Montez.\"\n\n\"I cannot deny,\" I said, \"that nothing will attract a man more than\nthe picture of a beautiful, passionate, cruel, and despotic woman who\nwantonly changes her favorites without scruple in accordance with her\nwhim--\"\n\n\"And in addition wears furs,\" exclaimed the divinity.\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"I know your predilection.\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" I interrupted, \"that, since we last saw each other,\nyou have grown very coquettish.\"\n\n\"In what way, may I ask?\"\n\n\"In that there is no way of accentuating your white body to greater\nadvantage than by these dark furs, and that--\"\n\nThe divinity laughed.\n\n\"You are dreaming,\" she cried, \"wake up!\" and she clasped my arm\nwith her marble-white hand. \"Do wake up,\" she repeated raucously with\nthe low register of her voice. I opened my eyes with difficulty.\n\nI saw the hand which shook me, and suddenly it was brown as bronze;\nthe voice was the thick alcoholic voice of my cossack servant who\nstood before me at his full height of nearly six feet.\n\n\"Do get up,\" continued the good fellow, \"it is really disgraceful.\"\n\n\"What is disgraceful?\"\n\n\"To fall asleep in your clothes and with a book besides.\" He snuffed\nthe candles which had burned down, and picked up the volume which had\nfallen from my hand, \"with a book by\"--he looked at the title page--\n\"by Hegel. Besides it is high time you were starting for Mr.\nSeverin's who is expecting us for tea.\"\n\n\"A curious dream,\" said Severin when I had finished. He supported\nhis arms on his knees, resting his face in his delicate, finely\nveined hands, and fell to pondering.\n\nI knew that he wouldn't move for a long time, hardly even breathe. This\nactually happened, but I didn't consider his behavior as in any way\nremarkable. I had been on terms of close friendship with him for nearly\nthree years, and gotten used to his peculiarities. For it cannot be\ndenied that he was peculiar, although he wasn't quite the dangerous\nmadman that the neighborhood, or indeed the entire district of Kolomea,\nconsidered him to be. I found his personality not only interesting--and\nthat is why many also regarded me a bit mad--but to a degree\nsympathetic. For a Galician nobleman and land-owner, and considering his\nage--he was hardly over thirty--he displayed surprising sobriety, a\ncertain seriousness, even pedantry. He lived according to a minutely\nelaborated, half-philosophical, half-practical system, like clock-work;\nnot this alone, but also by the thermometer, barometer, aerometer,\nhydrometer, Hippocrates, Hufeland, Plato, Kant, Knigge, and Lord\nChesterfield. But at times he had violent attacks of sudden passion, and\ngave the impression of being about to run with his head right through a\nwall. At such times every one preferred to get out of his way.\n\nWhile he remained silent, the fire sang in the chimney and the large\nvenerable samovar sang; and the ancient chair in which I sat rocking\nto and fro smoking my cigar, and the cricket in the old walls sang\ntoo. I let my eyes glide over the curious apparatus, skeletons of\nanimals, stuffed birds, globes, plaster-casts, with which his room\nwas heaped full, until by chance my glance remained fixed on a\npicture which I had seen often enough before. But to-day, under the\nreflected red glow of the fire, it made an indescribable impression\non me.\n\nIt was a large oil painting, done in the robust full-bodied manner\nof the Belgian school. Its subject was strange enough.\n\nA beautiful woman with a radiant smile upon her face, with abundant\nhair tied into a classical knot, on which white powder lay like a\nsoft hoarfrost, was resting on an ottoman, supported on her left arm.\nShe was nude in her dark furs. Her right hand played with a lash,\nwhile her bare foot rested carelessly on a man, lying before her like\na slave, like a dog. In the sharply outlined, but well-formed\nlinaments of this man lay brooding melancholy and passionate\ndevotion; he looked up to her with the ecstatic burning eye of a\nmartyr. This man, the footstool for her feet, was Severin, but\nbeardless, and, it seemed, some ten years younger.\n\n\"_Venus in Furs_,\" I cried, pointing to the picture. \"That is the way\nI saw her in my dream.\"\n\n\"I, too,\" said Severin, \"only I dreamed my dream with open eyes.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"It is a tiresome story.\"\n\n\"Your picture apparently suggested my dream,\" I continued. \"But do\ntell me what it means. I can imagine that it played a role in your\nlife, and perhaps a very decisive one. But the details I can only get\nfrom you.\"\n\n\"Look at its counterpart,\" replied my strange friend, without\nheeding my question.\n\nThe counterpart was an excellent copy of Titian's well-known \"Venus\nwith the Mirror\" in the Dresden Gallery.\n\n\"And what is the significance?\"\n\nSeverin rose and pointed with his finger at the fur with which\nTitian garbed his goddess of love.\n\n\"It, too, is a 'Venus in Furs,'\" he said with a slight smile. \"I\ndon't believe that the old Venetian had any secondary intention. He\nsimply painted the portrait of some aristocratic Mesalina, and was\ntactful enough to let Cupid hold the mirror in which she tests her\nmajestic allure with cold satisfaction. He looks as though his task\nwere becoming burdensome enough. The picture is painted flattery.\nLater an 'expert' in the Rococo period baptized the lady with the\nname of Venus. The furs of the despot in which Titian's fair model\nwrapped herself, probably more for fear of a cold than out of\nmodesty, have become a symbol of the tyranny and cruelty that\nconstitute woman's essence and her beauty.\n\n\"But enough of that. The picture, as it now exists, is a bitter\nsatire on our love. Venus in this abstract North, in this icy\nChristian world, has to creep into huge black furs so as not to catch\ncold--\"\n\nSeverin laughed, and lighted a fresh cigarette.\n\nJust then the door opened and an attractive, stoutish, blonde girl\nentered. She had wise, kindly eyes, was dressed in black silk, and\nbrought us cold meat and eggs with our tea. Severin took one of the\nlatter, and decapitated it with his knife.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you that I want them soft-boiled?\" he cried with a\nviolence that made the young woman tremble.\n\n\"But my dear Sevtchu--\" she said timidly.\n\n\"Sevtchu, nothing,\" he yelled, \"you are to obey, obey, do you\nunderstand?\" and he tore the _kantchuk_ [Footnote: A long whip with a\nshort handle.] which was hanging beside the weapons from its hook.\n\nThe woman fled from the chamber quickly and timidly like a doe.\n\n\"Just wait, I'll get you yet,\" he called after her.\n\n\"But Severin,\" I said placing my hand on his arm, \"how can you treat\na pretty young woman thus?\"\n\n\"Look at the woman,\" he replied, blinking humorously with his eyes.\n\"Had I flattered her, she would have cast the noose around my neck,\nbut now, when I bring her up with the _kantchuk_, she adores me.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\"\n\n\"Nonsense, nothing, that is the way you have to break in women.\"\n\n\"Well, if you like it, live like a pasha in your harem, but don't\nlay down theories for me--\"\n\n\"Why not,\" he said animatedly. \"Goethe's 'you must be hammer or anvil'\nis absolutely appropriate to the relation between man and woman.\nDidn't Lady Venus in your dream prove that to you? Woman's power lies\nin man's passion, and she knows how to use it, if man doesn't\nunderstand himself. He has only one choice: to be the _tyrant_ over or\nthe _slave_ of woman. As soon as he gives in, his neck is under the\nyoke, and the lash will soon fall upon him.\"\n\n\"Strange maxims!\"\n\n\"Not maxims, but experiences,\" he replied, nodding his head, \"_I have\nactually felt the lash_. I am cured. Do you care to know how?\"\n\nHe rose, and got a small manuscript from his massive desk, and put\nit in front of me.\n\n\"You have already asked about the picture. I have long owed you an\nexplanation. Here--read!\"\n\nSeverin sat down by the chimney with his back toward me, and seemed\nto dream with open eyes. Silence had fallen again, and again the fire\nsang in the chimney, and the samovar and the cricket in the old\nwalls. I opened the manuscript and read:\n\nCONFESSIONS OF A SUPERSENSUAL MAN.\n\nThe margin of the manuscript bore as motto a variation of the well-known\nlines from _Faust_:\n\n\"Thou supersensual sensual wooer\nA woman leads you by the nose.\"\n--MEPHISTOPHELES.\n\nI turned the title-page and read: \"What follows has been compiled\nfrom my diary of that period, because it is impossible ever frankly\nto write of one's past, but in this way everything retains its fresh\ncolors, the colors of the present.\"\n\nGogol, the Russian Moliere, says--where? well, somewhere--\"the real\ncomic muse is the one under whose laughing mask tears roll down.\"\n\nA wonderful saying.\n\nSo I have a very curious feeling as I am writing all this down. The\natmosphere seems filled with a stimulating fragrance of flowers,\nwhich overcomes me and gives me a headache. The smoke of the\nfireplace curls and condenses into figures, small gray-bearded\nkokolds that mockingly point their finger at me. Chubby-cheeked\ncupids ride on the arms of my chair and on my knees. I have to smile\ninvoluntarily, even laugh aloud, as I am writing down my adventures.\nYet I am not writing with ordinary ink, but with red blood that drips\nfrom my heart. All its wounds long scarred over have opened and it\nthrobs and hurts, and now and then a tear falls on the paper.\n\nThe days creep along sluggishly in the little Carpathian health-resort.\nYou see no one, and no one sees you. It is boring enough to write idyls.\nI would have leisure here to supply a whole gallery of paintings,\nfurnish a theater with new pieces for an entire season, a dozen\nvirtuosos with concertos, trios, and duos, but--what am I saying--the\nupshot of it all is that I don't do much more than to stretch the\ncanvas, smooth the bow, line the scores. For I am--no false modesty,\nFriend Severin; you can lie to others, but you don't quite succeed any\nlonger in lying to yourself--I am nothing but a dilettante, a dilettante\nin painting, in poetry, in music, and several other of the so-called\nunprofitable arts, which, however, at present secure for their masters\nthe income of a cabinet minister, or even that of a minor potentate.\nAbove all else I am a dilettante in life.\n\nUp to the present I have lived as I have painted and written poetry.\nI never got far beyond the preparation, the plan, the first act, the\nfirst stanza. There are people like that who begin everything, and\nnever finish anything. I am such a one.\n\nBut what am I saying?\n\nTo the business in hand.\n\nI lie in my window, and the miserable little town, which fills me\nwith despondency, really seems infinitely full of poetry. How\nwonderful the outlook upon the blue wall of high mountains interwoven\nwith golden sunlight; mountain-torrents weave through them like\nribbons of silver! How clear and blue the heavens into which\nsnowcapped crags project; how green and fresh the forested slopes;\nthe meadows on which small herds graze, down to the yellow billows\nof grain where reapers stand and bend over and rise up again.\n\nThe house in which I live stands in a sort of park, or forest, or\nwilderness, whatever one wants to call it, and is very solitary.\n\nIts sole inhabitants are myself, a widow from Lemberg, and Madame\nTartakovska, who runs the house, a little old woman, who grows older\nand smaller each day. There are also an old dog that limps on one\nleg, and a young cat that continually plays with a ball of yarn. This\nball of yarn, I believe, belongs to the widow.\n\nShe is said to be really beautiful, this widow, still very young,\ntwenty-four at the most, and very rich. She dwells in the first story,\nand I on the ground floor. She always keeps the green blinds drawn, and\nhas a balcony entirely overgrown with green climbing-plants. I for my\npart down below have a comfortable, intimate arbor of honeysuckle, in\nwhich I read and write and paint and sing like a bird among the twigs. I\ncan look up on the balcony. Sometimes I actually do so, and then from\ntime to time a white gown gleams between the dense green network.\n\nReally the beautiful woman up there doesn't interest me very much, for I\nam in love with someone else, and terribly unhappy at that; far more\nunhappy than the Knight of Toggenburg or the Chevalier in Manon\nl'Escault, because the object of my adoration is of stone.\n\nIn the garden, in the tiny wilderness, there is a graceful little\nmeadow on which a couple of deer graze peacefully. On this meadow is\na stone statue of Venus, the original of which, I believe, is in\nFlorence. This Venus is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in\nall my life.\n\nThat, however, does not signify much, for I have seen few beautiful\nwomen, or rather few women at all. In love too, I am a dilettante who\nnever got beyond the preparation, the first act.\n\nBut why talk in superlatives, as if something that is beautiful\ncould be surpassed?\n\nIt is sufficient to say that this Venus is beautiful. I love her\npassionately with a morbid intensity; madly as one can only love a\nwoman who never responds to our love with anything but an eternally\nuniform, eternally calm, stony smile. I literally adore her.\n\nI often lie reading under the leafy covering of a young birch when\nthe sun broods over the forest. Often I visit that cold, cruel\nmistress of mine by night and lie on my knees before her, with the\nface pressed against the cold pedestal on which her feet rest, and\nmy prayers go up to her.\n\nThe rising moon, which just now is waning, produces an indescribable\neffect. It seems to hover among the trees and submerges the meadow\nin its gleam of silver. The goddess stands as if transfigured, and\nseems to bathe in the soft moonlight.\n\nOnce when I was returning from my devotions by one of the walks\nleading to the house, I suddenly saw a woman's figure, white as\nstone, under the illumination of the moon and separated from me\nmerely by a screen of trees. It seemed as if the beautiful woman of\nmarble had taken pity on me, become alive, and followed me. I was\nseized by a nameless fear, my heart threatened to burst, and instead--\n\nWell, I am a dilettante. As always, I broke down at the second\nstanza; rather, on the contrary, I did not break down, but ran away\nas fast as my legs would carry me.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat an accident! Through a Jew, dealing in photographs I secured a\npicture of my ideal. It is a small reproduction of Titian's \"Venus\nwith the Mirror.\" What a woman! I want to write a poem, but instead,\nI take the reproduction, and write on it: _Venus in Furs_.\n\nYou are cold, while you yourself fan flames. By all means wrap\nyourself in your despotic furs, there is no one to whom they are more\nappropriate, cruel goddess of love and of beauty!--After a while I add\na few verses from Goethe, which I recently found in his paralipomena\nto _Faust_.\n\nTO AMOR\n\n\"The pair of wings a fiction are,\nThe arrows, they are naught but claws,\nThe wreath conceals the little horns,\nFor without any doubt he is\nLike all the gods of ancient Greece\nOnly a devil in disguise.\"\n\nThen I put the picture before me on my table, supporting it with a\nbook, and looked at it.\n\nI was enraptured and at the same time filled with a strange fear by\nthe cold coquetry with which this magnificent woman draped her charms\nin her furs of dark sable; by the severity and hardness which lay in\nthis cold marble-like face. Again I took my pen in hand, and wrote\nthe following words:\n\n\"To love, to be loved, what happiness! And yet how the glamour of\nthis pales in comparison with the tormenting bliss of worshipping a\nwoman who makes a plaything out of us, of being the slave of a\nbeautiful tyrant who treads us pitilessly underfoot. Even Samson, the\nhero, the giant, again put himself into the hands of Delilah, even\nafter she had betrayed him, and again she betrayed him, and the\nPhilistines bound him and put out his eyes which until the very end\nhe kept fixed, drunken with rage and love, upon the beautiful\nbetrayer.\"\n\nI was breakfasting in my honey-suckle arbor, and reading in the Book\nof Judith. I envied the hero Holofernes because of the regal woman\nwho cut off his head with a sword, and because of his beautiful\nsanguinary end.\n\n\"The almighty Lord hath struck him, and hath delivered him into the\nhands of a woman.\"\n\nThis sentence strangely impressed me.\n\nHow ungallant these Jews are, I thought. And their God might choose\nmore becoming expressions when he speaks of the fair sex.\n\n\"The almighty Lord hath struck him, and hath delivered him into the\nhands of a woman,\" I repeated to myself. What shall I do, so that He\nmay punish me?\n\nHeaven preserve us! Here comes the housekeeper, who has again\ndiminished somewhat in size overnight. And up there among the green\ntwinings and garlandings the white gown gleams again. Is it Venus,\nor the widow?\n\nThis time it happens to be the widow, for Madame Tartakovska makes\na courtesy, and asks me in her name for something to read. I run to\nmy room, and gather together a couple of volumes.\n\nLater I remember that my picture of Venus is in one of them, and now\nit and my effusions are in the hands of the white woman up there\ntogether. What will she say?\n\nI hear her laugh.\n\nIs she laughing at me?\n\nIt is full moon. It is already peering over the tops of the low\nhemlocks that fringe the park. A silvery exhalation fills the\nterrace, the groups of trees, all the landscape, as far as the eye\ncan reach; in the distance it gradually fades away, like trembling\nwaters.\n\nI cannot resist. I feel a strange urge and call within me. I put on\nmy clothes again and go out into the garden.\n\nSome power draws me toward the meadow, toward her, who is my\ndivinity and my beloved.\n\nThe night is cool. I feel a slight chill. The atmosphere is heavy\nwith the odor of flowers and of the forest. It intoxicates.\n\nWhat solemnity! What music round about! A nightingale sobs. The\nstars quiver very faintly in the pale-blue glamour. The meadow seems\nsmooth, like a mirror, like a covering of ice on a pond.\n\nThe statue of Venus stands out august and luminous.\n\nBut--what has happened? From the marble shoulders of the goddess a\nlarge dark fur flows down to her heels. I stand dumbfounded and stare\nat her in amazement; again an indescribable fear seizes hold of me\nand I take flight.\n\nI hasten my steps, and notice that I have missed the main path. As\nI am about to turn aside into one of the green walks I see Venus\nsitting before me on a stone bench, not the beautiful woman of\nmarble, but the goddess of love herself with warm blood and throbbing\npulses. She has actually come to life for me, like the statue that\nbegan to breathe for her creator. Indeed, the miracle is only half\ncompleted. Her white hair seems still to be of stone, and her white\ngown shimmers like moonlight, or is it satin? From her shoulders the\ndark fur flows. But her lips are already reddening and her cheeks\nbegin to take color. Two diabolical green rays out of her eyes fall\nupon me, and now she laughs.\n\nHer laughter is very mysterious, very--I don't know. It cannot be\ndescribed, it takes my breath away. I flee further, and after every\nfew steps I have to pause to take breath. The mocking laughter\npursues me through the dark leafy paths, across light open spaces,\nthrough the thicket where only single moonbeams can pierce. I can no\nlonger find my way, I wander about utterly confused, with cold drops\nof perspiration on the forehead.\n\nFinally I stand still, and engage in a short monologue.\n\nIt runs--well--one is either very polite to one's self or very rude.\n\nI say to myself:\n\n\"Donkey!\"\n\nThis word exercises a remarkable effect, like a magic formula, which\nsets me free and makes me master of myself.\n\nI am perfectly quiet in a moment.\n\nWith considerable pleasure I repeat: \"Donkey!\"\n\nNow everything is perfectly clear and distinct before my eyes again.\nThere is the fountain, there the alley of box-wood, there the house\nwhich I am slowly approaching.\n\nYet--suddenly the appearance is here again. Behind the green screen\nthrough which the moonlight gleams so that it seems embroidered with\nsilver, I again see the white figure, the woman of stone whom I\nadore, whom I fear and flee.\n\nWith a couple of leaps I am within the house and catch my breath and\nreflect.\n\nWhat am I really, a little dilettante or a great big donkey?\n\nA sultry morning, the atmosphere is dead, heavily laden with odors,\nyet stimulating. Again I am sitting in my honey-suckle arbor, reading\nin the Odyssey about the beautiful witch who transformed her admirers\ninto beasts. A wonderful picture of antique love.\n\nThere is a soft rustling in the twigs and blades and the pages of my\nbook rustle and on the terrace likewise there is a rustling.\n\nA woman's dress--\n\nShe is there--Venus--but without furs--No, this time it is merely\nthe widow--and yet--Venus-oh, what a woman!\n\nAs she stands there in her light white morning gown, looking at me, her\nslight figure seems full of poetry and grace. She is neither large, nor\nsmall; her head is alluring, piquant--in the sense of the period of the\nFrench marquises--rather than formally beautiful. What enchantment and\nsoftness, what roguish charm play about her none too small mouth! Her\nskin is so infinitely delicate, that the blue veins show through\neverywhere; even through the muslin covering her arms and bosom. How\nabundant her red hair-it is red, not blonde or golden-yellow--how\ndiabolically and yet tenderly it plays around her neck! Now her eyes\nmeet mine like green lightnings--they are green, these eyes of hers,\nwhose power is so indescribable--green, but as are precious stones, or\ndeep unfathomable mountain lakes.\n\nShe observes my confusion, which has even made me discourteous, for I\nhave remained seated and still have my cap on my head.\n\nShe smiles roguishly.\n\nFinally I rise and bow to her. She comes closer, and bursts out into\na loud, almost childlike laughter. I stammer, as only a little\ndilettante or great big donkey can do on such an occasion.\n\nThus our acquaintance began.\n\nThe divinity asks for my name, and mentions her own.\n\nHer name is Wanda von Dunajew.\n\nAnd she is actually my Venus.\n\n\"But madame, what put the idea into your head?\"\n\n\"The little picture in one of your books--\"\n\n\"I had forgotten about it.\"\n\n\"The curious notes on its back--\"\n\n\"Why curious?\"\n\nShe looked at me.\n\n\"I have always wanted to know a real dreamer some time--for the sake\nof the change--and you seem one of the maddest of the tribe.\"\n\n\"Dear lady--in fact--\" Again I fell victim to an odious, asinine\nstammering, and in addition blushed in a way that might have been\nappropriate for a youngster of sixteen, but not for me, who was\nalmost a full ten years older--\n\n\"You were afraid of me last night.\"\n\n\"Really--of course--but won't you sit down?\"\n\nShe sat down, and enjoyed my embarrassment--for actually I was even\nmore afraid of her now in the full light of day. A delightful\nexpression of contempt hovered about her upper lip.\n\n\"You look at love, and especially woman,\" she began, \"as something\nhostile, something against which you put up a defense, even if\nunsuccessfully. You feel that their power over you gives you a\nsensation of pleasurable torture, of pungent cruelty. This is a\ngenuinely modern point of view.\"\n\n\"You don't share it?\"\n\n\"I do not share it,\" she said quickly and decisively, shaking her\nhead, so that her curls flew up like red flames.\n\n\"The ideal which I strive to realize in my life is the serene\nsensuousness of the Greeks--pleasure without pain. I do not believe\nin the kind of love which is preached by Christianity, by the\nmoderns, by the knights of the spirit. Yes, look at me, I am worse\nthan a heretic, I am a pagan.\n\n'Doest thou imagine long the goddess of love took counsel\nWhen in Ida's grove she was pleased with the hero Achilles?'\n\n\"These lines from Goethe's _Roman Elegy_ have always delighted me.\n\n\"In nature there is only the love of the heroic age, 'when gods and\ngoddesses loved.' At that time 'desire followed the glance, enjoyment\ndesire.' All else is factitious, affected, a lie. Christianity, whose\ncruel emblem, the cross, has always had for me an element of the\nmonstrous, brought something alien and hostile into nature and its\ninnocent instincts.\n\n\"The battle of the spirit with the senses is the gospel of modern\nman. I do not care to have a share in it.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mount Olympus would be the place for you, madame,\" I replied,\n\"but we moderns can no longer support the antique serenity, least of\nall in love. The idea of sharing a woman, even if it were an Aspasia,\nwith another revolts us. We are jealous as is our God. For example,\nwe have made a term abuse out of the name of the glorious Phryne.\n\n\"We prefer one of Holbein's meagre, pallid virgins, which is wholly\nours to an antique Venus, no matter how divinely beautiful she is,\nbut who loves Anchises to-day, Paris to-morrow, Adonis the day after.\nAnd if nature triumphs in us so that we give our whole glowing,\npassionate devotion to such a woman, her serene joy of life appears\nto us as something demonic and cruel, and we read into our happiness\na sin which we must expiate.\"\n\n\"So you too are one of those who rave about modern women, those\nmiserable hysterical feminine creatures who don't appreciate a real\nman in their somnambulistic search for some dream-man and masculine\nideal. Amid tears and convulsions they daily outrage their Christian\nduties; they cheat and are cheated; they always seek again and choose\nand reject; they are never happy, and never give happiness. They\naccuse fate instead of calmly confessing that they want to love and\nlive as Helen and Aspasia lived. Nature admits of no permanence in\nthe relation between man and woman.\"\n\n\"But, my dear lady--\"\n\n\"Let me finish. It is only man's egoism which wants to keep woman\nlike some buried treasure. All endeavors to introduce permanence in\nlove, the most changeable thing in this changeable human existence,\nhave gone shipwreck in spite of religious ceremonies, vows, and\nlegalities. Can you deny that our Christian world has given itself\nover to corruption?\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"But you are about to say, the individual who rebels against the\narrangements of society is ostracized, branded, stoned. So be it. I\nam willing to take the risk; my principles are very pagan. I will\nlive my own life as it pleases me. I am willing to do without your\nhypocritical respect; I prefer to be happy. The inventors of the\nChristian marriage have done well, simultaneously to invent\nimmortality. I, however, have no wish to live eternally. When with\nmy last breath everything as far as Wanda von Dunajew is concerned\ncomes to an end here below, what does it profit me whether my pure\nspirit joins the choirs of angels, or whether my dust goes into the\nformation of new beings? Shall I belong to one man whom I don't love,\nmerely because I have once loved him? No, I do not renounce; I love\neveryone who pleases me, and give happiness to everyone who loves me.\nIs that ugly? No, it is more beautiful by far, than if cruelly I\nenjoy the tortures, which my beauty excites, and virtuously reject\nthe poor fellow who is pining away for me. I am young, rich, and\nbeautiful, and I live serenely for the sake of pleasure and\nenjoyment.\"\n\nWhile she was speaking her eyes sparkled roguishly, and I had taken\nhold of her hands without exactly knowing what to do with them, but\nbeing a genuine dilettante I hastily let go of them again.\n\n\"Your frankness,\" I said, \"delights me, and not it alone--\"\n\nMy confounded dilettantism again throttled me as though there were\na rope around my neck.\n\n\"You were about to say--\"\n\n\"I was about to say--I was--I am sorry--I interrupted you.\"\n\n\"How, so?\"\n\nA long pause. She is doubtless engaging in a monologue, which\ntranslated into my language would be comprised in the single word,\n\"donkey.\"\n\n\"If I may ask,\" I finally began, \"how did you arrive at these--these\nconclusions?\"\n\n\"Quite simply, my father was an intelligent man. From my cradle onward\nI was surrounded by replicas of ancient art; at ten years of age I\nread _Gil Blas_, at twelve _La Pucelle_. Where others had\nHop-o'-my-thumb, Bluebeard, Cinderella, as childhood friends, mine\nwere Venus and Apollo, Hercules and Lackoon. My husband's personality\nwas filled with serenity and sunlight. Not even the incurable illness\nwhich fell upon him soon after our marriage could long cloud his brow.\nOn the very night of his death he took me in his arms, and during the\nmany months when he lay dying in his wheel chair, he often said\njokingly to me: 'Well, have you already picked out a lover?' I blushed\nwith shame. 'Don't deceive me,' he added on one occasion, 'that would\nseem ugly to me, but pick out an attractive lover, or preferably\nseveral. You are a splendid woman, but still half a child, and you\nneed toys.'\n\n\"I suppose, I hardly need tell you that during his life time I had\nno lover; but it was through him that I have become what I am, a\nwoman of Greece.\"\n\n\"A goddess,\" I interrupted.\n\n\"Which one,\" she smiled.\n\n\"Venus.\"\n\nShe threatened me with her finger and knitted her brows. \"Perhaps,\neven a 'Venus in Furs.' Watch out, I have a large, very large fur,\nwith which I could cover you up entirely, and I have a mind to catch\nyou in it as in a net.\"\n\n\"Do you believe,\" I said quickly, for an idea which seemed good, in\nspite of its conventionality and triteness, flashed into my head, \"do\nyou believe that your theories could be carried into execution at the\npresent time, that Venus would be permitted to stray with impunity\namong our railroads and telegraphs in all her undraped beauty and\nserenity?\"\n\n\"_Undraped_, of course not, but in furs,\" she replied smiling, \"would\nyou care to see mine?\"\n\n\"And then--\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Beautiful, free, serene, and happy human beings, such as the Greeks\nwere, are only possible when it is permitted to have _slaves_ who will\nperform the prosaic tasks of every day for them and above all else\nlabor for them.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" she replied playfully, \"an Olympian divinity, such as\nI am, requires a whole army of slaves. Beware of me!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nI myself was frightened at the hardiness with which I uttered this\n\"why\"; it did not startle her in the least.\n\nShe drew back her lips a little so that her small white teeth became\nvisible, and then said lightly, as if she were discussing some\ntrifling matter, \"Do you want to be my slave?\"\n\n\"There is no equality in love,\" I replied solemnly. \"Whenever it is\na matter of choice for me of ruling or being ruled, it seems much\nmore satisfactory to me to be the slave of a beautiful woman. But\nwhere shall I find the woman who knows how to rule, calmly, full of\nself-confidence, even harshly, and not seek to gain her power by\nmeans of petty nagging?\"\n\n\"Oh, that might not be so difficult.\"\n\n\"You think--\"\n\n\"I--for instance--\" she laughed and leaned far back--\"I have a real\ntalent for despotism--I also have the necessary furs--but last night\nyou were really seriously afraid of me!\"\n\n\"Quite seriously.\"\n\n\"And now?\"\n\n\"Now, I am more afraid of you than ever!\"\n\nWe are together every day, I and--Venus; we are together a great\ndeal. We breakfast in my honey-suckle arbor, and have tea in her\nlittle sitting-room. I have an opportunity to unfold all my small,\nvery small talents. Of what use would have been my study of all the\nvarious sciences, my playing at all the arts, if I were unable in the\ncase of a pretty, little woman--\n\nBut this woman is by no means little; in fact she impresses me\ntremendously. I made a drawing of her to-day, and felt particularly\nclearly, how inappropriate the modern way of dressing is for a\ncameo-head like hers. The configuration of her face has little of the\nRoman, but much of the Greek.\n\nSometimes I should like to paint her as Psyche, and then again as\nAstarte. It depends upon the expression in her eyes, whether it is\nvaguely dreamy, or half-consuming, filled with tired desire.\nShe, however, insists that it be a portrait-likeness.\n\nI shall make her a present of furs.\n\nHow could I have any doubts? If not for her, for whom would princely\nfurs be suitable?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI was with her yesterday evening, reading the _Roman Elegies_ to her.\nThen I laid the book aside, and improvised something for her. She\nseemed pleased; rather more than that, she actually hung upon my\nwords, and her bosom heaved.\n\nOr was I mistaken?\n\nThe rain beat in melancholy fashion on the window-panes, the fire\ncrackled in the fireplace in wintery comfort. I felt quite at home\nwith her, and for a moment lost all my fear of this beautiful woman;\nI kissed her hand, and she permitted it.\n\nThen I sat down at her feet and read a short poem I had written for\nher.\n\nVENUS IN FURS.\n\n\"Place thy foot upon thy slave,\nOh thou, half of hell, half of dreams;\nAmong the shadows, dark and grave,\nThy extended body softly gleams.\"\n\nAnd--so on. This time I really got beyond the first stanza. At her\nrequest I gave her the poem in the evening, keeping no copy. And now\nas I am writing this down in my diary I can only remember the first\nstanza.\n\nI am filled with a very curious sensation. I don't believe that I am\nin love with Wanda; I am sure that at our first meeting, I felt\nnothing of the lightning-like flashes of passion. But I feel how her\nextraordinary, really divine beauty is gradually winding magic snares\nabout me. It isn't any spiritual sympathy which is growing in me; it\nis a physical subjection, coming on slowly, but for that reason more\nabsolutely.\n\nI suffer under it more and more each day, and she--she merely smiles.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWithout any provocation she suddenly said to me to-day: \"You\ninterest me. Most men are very commonplace, without verve or poetry.\nIn you there is a certain depth and capacity for enthusiasm and a\ndeep seriousness, which delight me. I might learn to love you.\"\n\nAfter a short but severe shower we went out together to the meadow\nand the statue of Venus. All about us the earth steamed; mists rose\nup toward heaven like clouds of incense; a shattered rainbow still\nhovered in the air. The trees were still shedding drops, but sparrows\nand finches were already hopping from twig to twig. They are\ntwittering gaily, as if very much pleased at something. Everything\nis filled with a fresh fragrance. We cannot cross the meadow for it\nis still wet. In the sunlight it looks like a small pool, and the\ngoddess of love seems to rise from the undulations of its mirror-like\nsurface. About her head a swarm of gnats is dancing, which,\nilluminated by the sun, seem to hover above her like an aureole.\n\nWanda is enjoying the lovely scene. As all the benches along the\nwalk are still wet, she supports herself on my arm to rest a while.\nA soft weariness permeates her whole being, her eyes are half closed;\nI feel the touch of her breath on my cheek.\n\nHow I managed to get up courage enough I really don't know, but I\ntook hold of her hand, asking,\n\n\"Could you love me?\"\n\n\"Why not,\" she replied, letting her calm, clear look rest upon me,\nbut not for long.\n\nA moment later I am kneeling before her, pressing my burning face\nagainst the fragrant muslin of her gown.\n\n\"But Severin--this isn't right,\" she cried.\n\nBut I take hold of her little foot, and press my lips upon it.\n\n\"You are getting worse and worse!\" she cried. She tore herself free,\nand fled rapidly toward the house, the while her adorable slipper\nremained in my hand.\n\nIs it an omen?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAll day long I didn't dare to go near her. Toward evening as I was\nsitting in my arbor her gay red head peered suddenly through the\ngreenery of her balcony. \"Why don't you come up?\" he called down\nimpatiently.\n\nI ran upstairs, and at the top lost courage again. I knocked very\nlightly. She didn't say come-in, but opened the door herself, and\nstood on the threshold.\n\n\"Where is my slipper?\"\n\n\"It is--I have--I want,\" I stammered.\n\n\"Get it, and then we will have tea together, and chat.\"\n\nWhen I returned, she was engaged in making tea. I ceremoniously\nplaced the slipper on the table, and stood in the corner like a child\nawaiting punishment.\n\nI noticed that her brows were slightly contracted, and there was an\nexpression of hardness and dominance about her lips which delighted\nme.\n\nAll of a sudden she broke out laughing.\n\n\"So--you are really in love--with me?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I suffer more from it than you can imagine?\"\n\n\"You suffer?\" she laughed again.\n\nI was revolted, mortified, annihilated, but all this was quite\nuseless.\n\n\"Why?\" she continued, \"I like you, with all my heart.\"\n\nShe gave me her hand, and looked at me in the friendliest fashion.\n\n\"And will you be my wife?\"\n\nWanda looked at me--how did she look at me? I think first of all\nwith surprise, and then with a tinge of irony.\n\n\"What has given you so much courage, all at once?\"\n\n\"Courage?\"\n\n\"Yes courage, to ask anyone to be your wife, and me in particular?\"\nShe lifted up the slipper. \"Was it through a sudden friendship with\nthis? But joking aside. Do you really wish to marry me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, Severin, that is a serious matter. I believe, you love me,\nand I care for you too, and what is more important each of us finds\nthe other interesting. There is no danger that we would soon get\nbored, but, you know, I am a fickle person, and just for that reason\nI take marriage seriously. If I assume obligations, I want to be able\nto meet them. But I am afraid--no--it would hurt you.\"\n\n\"Please be perfectly frank with me,\" I replied.\n\n\"Well then honestly, I don't believe I could love a man longer than--\"\nShe inclined her head gracefully to one side and mused.\n\n\"A year.\"\n\n\"What do you imagine--a month perhaps.\"\n\n\"Not even me?\"\n\n\"Oh you--perhaps two.\"\n\n\"Two months!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Two months is very long.\"\n\n\"You go beyond antiquity, madame.\"\n\n\"You see, you cannot stand the truth.\"\n\nWanda walked across the room and leaned back against the fireplace,\nwatching me and resting one of her arms on the mantelpiece.\n\n\"What shall I do with you?\" she began anew.\n\n\"Whatever you wish,\" I replied with resignation, \"whatever will give\nyou pleasure.\"\n\n\"How illogical!\" she cried, \"first you want to make me your wife,\nand then you offer yourself to me as something to toy with.\"\n\n\"Wanda--I love you.\"\n\n\"Now we are back to the place where we started. You love me, and\nwant to make me your wife, but I don't want to enter into a new\nmarriage, because I doubt the permanence of both my and your\nfeelings.\"\n\n\"But if I am willing to take the risk with you?\" I replied.\n\n\"But it also depends on whether I am willing to risk it with you,\"\nshe said quietly. \"I can easily imagine belonging to one man for my\nentire life, but he would have to be a whole man, a man who would\ndominate me, who would subjugate me by his inate strength, do you\nunderstand? And every man--I know this very well--as soon as he falls\nin love becomes weak, pliable, ridiculous. He puts himself into the\nwoman's hands, kneels down before her. The only man whom I could love\npermanently would be he before whom I should have to kneel. I've gotten\nto like you so much, however, that I'll try it with you.\"\n\nI fell down at her feet.\n\n\"For heaven's sake, here you are kneeling already,\" she said\nmockingly. \"You are making a good beginning.\" When I had risen again\nshe continued, \"I will give you a year's time to win me, to convince\nme that we are suited to each other, that we might live together. If\nyou succeed, I will become your wife, and a wife, Severin, who will\nconscientiously and strictly perform all her duties. During this year\nwe will live as though we were married--\"\n\nMy blood rose to my head.\n\nIn her eyes too there was a sudden flame--\n\n\"We will live together,\" she continued, \"share our daily life, so that\nwe may find out whether we are really fitted for each other. _I grant\nyou all the rights of a husband, of a lover, of a friend._ Are you\nsatisfied?\"\n\n\"I suppose, I'll have to be?\"\n\n\"You don't have to.\"\n\n\"Well then, I want to--\"\n\n\"Splendid. That is how a man speaks. Here is my hand.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFor ten days I have been with her every hour, except at night. All\nthe time I was allowed to look into her eyes, hold her hands, listen\nto what she said, accompany her wherever she went.\n\nMy love seems to me like a deep, bottomless abyss, into which I\nsubside deeper and deeper. There is nothing now which could save me\nfrom it.\n\nThis afternoon we were resting on the meadow at the foot of the\nVenus-statue. I plucked flowers and tossed them into her lap; she\nwound them into wreaths with which we adorned our goddess.\n\nSuddenly Wanda looked at me so strangely that my senses became\nconfused and passion swept over my head like a conflagration. Losing\ncommand over myself, I threw my arms about her and clung to her lips,\nand she--she drew me close to her heaving breast.\n\n\"Are you angry?\" I then asked her.\n\n\"I am never angry at anything that is natural--\" she replied, \"but\n_I_ am afraid you suffer.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am suffering frightfully.\"\n\n\"Poor friend!\" she brushed my disordered hair back from my fore-head. \"I\nhope it isn't through any fault of mine.\"\n\n\"No--\" I replied,--\"and yet my love for you has become a sort of\nmadness. The thought that I might lose you, perhaps actually lose\nyou, torments me day and night.\"\n\n\"But you don't yet possess me,\" said Wanda, and again she looked at\nme with that vibrant, consuming expression, which had already once\nbefore carried me away. Then she rose, and with her small transparent\nhands placed a wreath of blue anemones upon the ringletted white head\nof Venus. Half against my will I threw my arm around her body.\n\n\"I can no longer live without you, oh wonderful woman,\" I said.\n\"Believe me, believe only this once, that this time it is not a\nphrase, not a thing of dreams. I feel deep down in my innermost soul,\nthat my life belongs inseparably with yours. If you leave me, I shall\nperish, go to pieces.\"\n\n\"That will hardly be necessary, for I love you,\" she took hold of my\nchin, \"you foolish man!\"\n\n\"But you will be mine only under conditions, while I belong to you\nunconditionally--\"\n\n\"That isn't wise, Severin,\" she replied almost with a start. \"Don't\nyou know me yet, do you absolutely refuse to know me? I am good when\nI am treated seriously and reasonably, but when you abandon yourself\ntoo absolutely to me, I grow arrogant--\"\n\n\"So be it, be arrogant, be despotic,\" I cried in the fulness of\nexaltation, \"only be mine, mine forever.\" I lay at her feet,\nembracing her knees.\n\n\"Things will end badly, my friend,\" she said soberly, without moving.\n\n\"It shall never end,\" I cried excitedly, almost violently. \"Only death\nshall part us. If you cannot be mine, all mine and for always, then _I\nwant to be your slave_, serve you, suffer everything from you, if only\nyou won't drive me away.\"\n\n\"Calm yourself,\" she said, bending down and kissing my forehead, \"I\nam really very fond of you, but your way is not the way to win and\nhold me.\"\n\n\"I want to do everything, absolutely everything, that you want, only\nnot to lose you,\" I cried, \"only not that, I cannot bear the thought.\"\n\n\"Do get up.\"\n\nI obeyed.\n\n\"You are a strange person,\" continued Wanda. \"You wish to possess me\nat any price?\"\n\n\"Yes, at any price.\"\n\n\"But of what value, for instance, would that be?\"--She pondered; a\nlurking uncanny expression entered her eyes--\"If I no longer loved\nyou, if I belonged to another.\"\n\nA shudder ran through me. I looked at her She stood firmly and\nconfident before me, and her eyes disclosed a cold gleam.\n\n\"You see,\" she continued, \"the very thought frightens you.\" A\nbeautiful smile suddenly illuminated her face.\n\n\"I feel a perfect horror, when I imagine, that the woman I love and\nwho has responded to my love could give herself to another regardless\nof me. But have I still a choice? If I love such a woman, even unto\nmadness, shall I turn my back to her and lose everything for the sake\nof a bit of boastful strength; shall I send a bullet through my\nbrains? I have two ideals of woman. If I cannot obtain the one that\nis noble and simple, the woman who will faithfully and truly share\nmy life, well then I don't want anything half-way or lukewarm. Then\nI would rather be subject to a woman without virtue, fidelity, or pity.\nSuch a woman in her magnificent selfishness is likewise an ideal. If\nI am not permitted to enjoy the happiness of love, fully and wholly,\nI want to taste its pains and torments to the very dregs; I want to\nbe maltreated and betrayed by the woman I love, and the more cruelly\nthe better. This too is a luxury.\"\n\n\"Have you lost your senses,\" cried Wanda.\n\n\"I love you with all my soul,\" I continued, \"with all my senses, and\nyour presence and personality are absolutely essential to me, if I\nam to go on living. Choose between my ideals. Do with me what you will,\nmake of me your husband or your slave.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Wanda, contracting her small but strongly arched\nbrows, \"it seems to me it would be rather entertaining to have a man,\nwho interests me and loves me, completely in my power; at least I\nshall not lack pastime. You were imprudent enough to leave the choice\nto me. Therefore I choose; I want you to be my slave, I shall make\na plaything for myself out of you!\"\n\n\"Oh, please do,\" I cried half-shuddering, half-enraptured. \"If the\nfoundation of marriage depends on equality and agreement, it is\nlikewise true that the greatest passions rise out of opposites. We\nare such opposites, almost enemies. That is why my love is part hate,\npart fear. In such a relation only one can be hammer and the other\nanvil. I wish to be the anvil. I cannot be happy when I look down\nupon the woman I love. I want to adore a woman, and this I can only\ndo when she is cruel towards me.\"\n\n\"But, Severin,\" replied Wanda, almost angrily, \"do you believe me\ncapable of maltreating a man who loves me as you do, and whom I love?\"\n\n\"Why not, if I adore you the more on this account? _It is possible to\nlove really only that which stands above us,_ a woman, who through her\nbeauty, temperament, intelligence, and strength of will subjugates us\nand becomes a despot over us.\"\n\n\"Then that which repels others, attracts you.\"\n\n\"Yes. That is the strange part of me.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, after all, there isn't anything so very unique or strange\nin all your passions, for who doesn't love beautiful furs? And\neveryone knows and feels how closely sexual love and cruelty are\nrelated.\"\n\n\"But in my case all these elements are raised to their highest\ndegree,\" I replied.\n\n\"In other words, reason has little power over you, and you are by\nnature, soft, sensual, yielding.\"\n\n\"Were the martyrs also soft and sensual by nature?\"\n\n\"The martyrs?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, they were _supersensual men,_ who found enjoyment in\nsuffering. They sought out the most frightful tortures, even death\nitself, as others seek joy, and as they were, so am I--_supersensual.\"_\n\n\"Have a care that in being such, you do not become a martyr to love,\nthe _martyr of a woman_.\"\n\nWe are sitting on Wanda's little balcony in the mellow fragrant\nsummer night. A twofold roof is above us, first the green ceiling of\nclimbing-plants, and then the vault of heaven sown with innumerable\nstars. The low wailing love-call of a cat rises from the park. I am\nsitting on footstool at the feet of my divinity, and am telling her\nof my childhood.\n\n\"And even then all these strange tendencies were distinctly marked\nin you?\" asked Wanda.\n\n\"Of course, I can't remember a time when I didn't have them. Even in\nmy cradle, so mother has told me, I was _supersensual._ I scorned the\nhealthy breast of my nurse, and had to be brought up on goats' milk.\nAs a little boy I was mysteriously shy before women, which really was\nonly an expression of an inordinate interest in them. I was oppressed\nby the gray arches and half-darknesses of the church, and actually\nafraid of the glittering altars and images of the saints. Secretly,\nhowever, I sneaked as to a secret joy to a plaster-Venus which stood\nin my father's little library. I kneeled down before her, and to her I\nsaid the prayers I had been taught--the Paternoster, the Ave Maria,\nand the Credo.\n\n\"Once at night I left my bed to visit her. The sickle of the moon\nwas my light and showed me the goddess in a pale-blue cold light. I\nprostrated myself before her and kissed her cold feet, as I had seen\nour peasants do when they kissed the feet of the dead Savior.\n\n\"An irresistible yearning seized me.\n\n\"I got up and embraced the beautiful cold body and kissed the cold\nlips. A deep shudder fell upon me and I fled, and later in a dream,\nit seemed to me, as if the goddess stood beside my bed, threatening\nme with up-raised arm.\n\n\"I was sent to school early and soon reached the gymnasium. I\npassionately grasped at everything which promised to make the world\nof antiquity accessible to me. Soon I was more familiar with the gods\nof Greece than with the religion of Jesus. I was with Paris when he\ngave the fateful apple to Venus, I saw Troy burn, and followed\nUlysses on his wanderings. The prototypes of all that is beautiful\nsank deep into my soul, and consequently at the time when other boys\nare coarse and obscene, I displayed an insurmountable aversion to\neverything base, vulgar, unbeautiful.\n\n\"To me, the maturing youth, love for women seemed something\nespecially base and unbeautiful, for it showed itself to me first in\nall its commonness. I avoided all contact with the fair sex; in\nshort, I was supersensual to madness.\n\n\"When I was about fourteen my mother had a charming chamber-maid,\nyoung, attractive, with a figure just budding into womanhood. I was\nsitting one day studying my Tacitus and growing enthusiastic over the\nvirtues of the ancient Teutons, while she was sweeping my room.\nSuddenly she stopped, bent down over me, in the meantime holding fast\nto the broom, and a pair of fresh, full, adorable lips touched mine.\nThe kiss of the enamoured little cat ran through me like a shudder,\nbut I raised up my _Germania_, like a shield against the temptress,\nand indignantly left the room.\"\n\nWanda broke out in loud laughter. \"It would, indeed, be hard to find\nanother man like you, but continue.\"\n\n\"There is another unforgetable incident belonging to that period,\"\nI continued my story. \"Countess Sobol, a distant aunt of mine, was\nvisiting my parents. She was a beautiful majestic woman with an\nattractive smile. I, however, hated her, for she was regarded by the\nfamily as a sort of Messalina. My behavior toward her was as rude,\nmalicious, and awkward as possible.\n\n\"One day my parents drove to the capital of the district. My aunt\ndetermined to take advantage of their absence, and to exercise\njudgment over me. She entered unexpectedly in her fur-lined\n_kazabaika,_ [Footnote: A woman's jacket.] followed by the cook,\nkitchen-maid, and the cat of a chamber-maid whom I had scorned.\nWithout asking any questions, they seized me and bound me hand and\nfoot, in spite of my violent resistance. Then my aunt, with an evil\nsmile, rolled up her sleeve and began to whip me with a stout switch.\nShe whipped so hard that the blood flowed, and that, at last,\nnotwithstanding my heroic spirit, I cried and wept and begged for\nmercy. She then had me untied, but I had to get down on my knees and\nthank her for the punishment and kiss her hand.\n\n\"Now you understand the supersensual fool! Under the lash of a\nbeautiful woman my senses first realized the meaning of woman. In her\nfur-jacket she seemed to me like a wrathful queen, and from then on\nmy aunt became the most desirable woman on God's earth.\n\n\"My Cato-like austerity, my shyness before woman, was nothing but an\nexcessive feeling for beauty. In my imagination sensuality became a\nsort of cult. I took an oath to myself that I would not squander its\nholy wealth upon any ordinary person, but I would reserve it for an\nideal woman, if possible for the goddess of love herself.\n\n\"I went to the university at a very early age. It was in the capital\nwhere my aunt lived. My room looked at that time like Doctor\nFaustus's. Everything in it was in a wild confusion. There were huge\nclosets stuffed full of books, which I bought for a song from a\nJewish dealer on the Servanica; [Footnote: The street of the Jews in\nLemberg.] there were globes, atlases, flasks, charts of the heavens,\nskeletons of animals, skulls, the busts of eminent men. It looked as\nthough Mephistopheles might have stepped out from behind the huge\ngreen store as a wandering scholiast at any moment.\n\n\"I studied everything in a jumble without system, without selection:\nchemistry, alchemy, history, astronomy, philosophy, law, anatomy, and\nliterature; I read Homer, Virgil, Ossian, Schiller, Goethe,\nShakespeare, Cervantes, Voltaire, Moliere, the Koran, the Kosmos,\nCasanova's Memoirs. I grew more confused each day, more fantastical,\nmore supersensual. All the time a beautiful ideal woman hovered in my\nimagination. Every so and so often she appeared before me like a\nvision among my leather-bound books and dead bones, lying on a bed of\nroses, surrounded by cupids. Sometimes she appeared gowned like the\nOlympians with the stern white face of the plaster Venus; sometimes in\nbraids of a rich brown, blue-eyes, in my aunt's red velvet\n_kazabaika,_ trimmed with ermine.\n\n\"One morning when she had again risen out of the golden mist of my\nimagination in all her smiling beauty, I went to see Countess Sobol,\nwho received me in a friendly, even cordial manner. She gave me a\nkiss of welcome, which put all my senses in a turmoil. She was\nprobably about forty years old, but like most well-preserved women\nof the world, still very attractive. She wore as always her fur-edged\njacket. This time it was one of green velvet with brown marten. But\nnothing of the sternness which had so delighted me the other time was\nnow discernable.\n\n\"On the contrary, there was so little of cruelty in her that without\nany more ado she let me adore her.\n\n\"Only too soon did she discover my supersensual folly and innocence,\nand it pleased her to make me happy. As for myself--I was as happy\nas a young god. What rapture for me to be allowed to lie before her\non my knees, and to kiss her hands, those with which she had scourged\nme! What marvellous hands they were, of beautiful form, delicate,\nrounded, and white, with adorable dimples! I really was in love with\nher hands only. I played with them, let them submerge and emerge in\nthe dark fur, held them against the light, and was unable to satiate\nmy eyes with them.\"\n\nWanda involuntarily looked at her hand; I noticed it, and had to\nsmile.\n\n\"From the way in which the supersensual predominated in me in those\ndays you can see that I was in love only with the cruel lashes I\nreceived from my aunt; and about two years later when I paid court\nto a young actress only in the roles she played. Still later I became\nthe admirer of a respectable woman. She acted the part of\nirreproachable virtue, only in the end to betray me with a rich Jew.\nYou see, it is because I was betrayed, sold, by a woman who feigned\nthe strictest principles and the highest ideals, that I hate that\nsort of poetical, sentimental virtue so intensely. Give me rather a\nwoman who is honest enough to say to me: I am a Pompadour, a Lucretia\nBorgia, and I am ready to adore her.\"\n\nWanda rose and opened the window.\n\n\"You have a curious way of arousing one's imagination, stimulating\nall one's nerves, and making one's pulses beat faster. You put an\naureole on vice, provided only if it is honest. Your ideal is a\ndaring courtesan of genius. Oh, you are the kind of man who will\ncorrupt a woman to her very last fiber.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the middle of the night there was a knock at my window; I got up,\nopened it, and was startled. Without stood \"Venus in Furs,\" just as\nshe had appeared to me the first time.\n\n\"You have disturbed me with your stories; I have been tossing about\nin bed, and can't go to sleep,\" she said. \"Now come and stay with me.\"\n\n\"In a moment.\"\n\nAs I entered Wanda was crouching by the fireplace where she had\nkindled a small fire.\n\n\"Autumn is coming,\" she began, \"the nights are really quite cold\nalready. I am afraid you may not like it, but I can't put off my furs\nuntil the room is sufficiently warm.\"\n\n\"Not like it--you are joking--you know--\" I threw my arm around her,\nand kissed her.\n\n\"Of course, I know, but why this great fondness for furs?\"\n\n\"I was born with it,\" I replied. \"I already had it as a child.\nFurthermore furs have a stimulating effect on all highly organized\nnatures. This is due both to general and natural laws. It is a\nphysical stimulus which sets you tingling, and no one can wholly\nescape it. Science has recently shown a certain relationship between\nelectricity and warmth; at any rate, their effects upon the human\norganism are related. The torrid zone produces more passionate\ncharacters, a heated atmosphere stimulation. Likewise with\nelectricity. This is the reason why the presence of cats exercises\nsuch a magic influence upon highly-organized men of intellect. This\nis why these long-tailed Graces of the animal kingdom, these\nadorable, scintillating electric batteries have been the favorite\nanimal of a Mahommed, Cardinal Richelieu, Crebillon, Rousseau,\nWieland.\"\n\n\"A woman wearing furs, then,\" cried Wanda, \"is nothing else than a\nlarge cat, an augmented electric battery?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I replied. \"That is my explanation of the symbolic\nmeaning which fur has acquired as the attribute of power and beauty.\nMonarchs and the dominant higher nobility in former times used it in\nthis sense for their costume, exclusively; great painters used it\nonly for queenly beauty. The most beautiful frame, which Raphael\ncould find for the divine forms of Fornarina and Titian for the\nroseate body of his beloved, was dark furs.\"\n\n\"Thanks for the learned discourse on love,\" said Wanda, \"but you\nhaven't told me everything. You associate something entirely\nindividual with furs.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I cried. \"I have repeatedly told you that suffering has\na peculiar attraction for me. Nothing can intensify my passion more\nthan tyranny, cruelty, and especially the faithlessness of a\nbeautiful woman. And I cannot imagine this woman, this strange ideal\nderived from an aesthetics of ugliness, this soul of Nero in the body\nof a Phryne, except in furs.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Wanda interrupted. \"It gives a dominant and imposing\nquality to a woman.\"\n\n\"Not only that,\" I continued. \"You know I am _supersensual._ With me\neverything has its roots in the imagination, and thence it receives\nits nourishment. I was already pre-maturely developed and highly\nsensitive, when at about the age of ten the legends of the martyrs\nfell into my hands. I remember reading with a kind of horror, which\nreally was rapture, of how they pined in prisons, were laid on the\ngridiron, pierced with arrows, boiled in pitch, thrown to wild\nanimals, nailed to the cross, and suffered the most horrible torment\nwith a kind of joy. To suffer and endure cruel torture from then on\nseemed to me exquisite delight, especially when it was inflicted by a\nbeautiful woman, for ever since I can remember all poetry and\neverything demonic was for me concentrated in woman. I literally\ncarried the idea into a sort of cult.\n\n\"I felt there was something sacred in sex; in fact, it was the only\nsacred thing. In woman and her beauty I saw something divine, because\nthe most important function of existence--the continuation of the\nspecies--is her vocation. To me woman represented a personification of\nnature, _Isis_, and man was her priest, her slave. In contrast to him\nshe was cruel like nature herself who tosses aside whatever has served\nher purposes as soon as she no longer has need for it. To him her\ncruelties, even death itself, still were sensual raptures.\n\n\"I envied King Gunther whom the mighty Brunhilde fettered on the\nbridal night, and the poor troubadour whom his capricious mistress\nhad sewed in the skins of wolves to have him hunted like game. I\nenvied the Knight Ctirad whom the daring Amazon Scharka craftily\nensnared in a forest near Prague, and carried to her castle Divin,\nwhere, after having amused herself a while with him, she had him\nbroken on the wheel--\"\n\n\"Disgusting,\" cried Wanda. \"I almost wish you might fall into the\nhands of a woman of their savage race. In the wolf's skin, under the\nteeth of the dogs, or upon the wheel, you would lose the taste for\nyour kind of poetry.\"\n\n\"Do you think so? I hardly do.\"\n\n\"Have you actually lost your senses.\"\n\n\"Possibly. But let me go on. I developed a perfect passion for\nreading stories in which the extremest cruelties were described. I\nloved especially to look at pictures and prints which represented\nthem. All the sanguinary tyrants that ever occupied a throne; the\ninquisitors who had the heretics tortured, roasted, and butchered;\nall the woman whom the pages of history have recorded as lustful,\nbeautiful, and violent women like Libussa, Lucretia Borgia, Agnes of\nHungary, Queen Margot, Isabeau, the Sultana Roxolane, the Russian\nCzarinas of last century--all these I saw in furs or in robes\nbordered with ermine.\"\n\n\"And so furs now rouse strange imaginings in you,\" said Wanda, and\nsimultaneously she began to drape her magnificent fur-cloak\ncoquettishly about her, so that the dark shining sable played\nbeautifully around her bust and arms. \"Well, how do you feel now,\nhalf broken on the wheel?\"\n\nHer piercing green eyes rested on me with a peculiar mocking\nsatisfaction. Overcome by desire, I flung myself down before her, and\nthrew my arms about her.\n\n\"Yes--you have awakened my dearest dream,\" I cried. \"It has slept\nlong enough.\"\n\n\"And this is?\" She put her hand on my neck.\n\nI was seized with a sweet intoxication under the influence of this\nwarm little hand and of her regard, which, tenderly searching, fell\nupon me through her half-closed lids.\n\n_\"To be the slave of a woman, a beautiful woman, whom I love, whom\nI worship.\"_\n\n\"And who on that account maltreats you,\" interrupted Wanda, laughing.\n\n\"Yes, who fetters me and whips me, treads me underfoot, the while\nshe gives herself to another.\"\n\n\"And who in her wantonness will go so far as to make a present of\nyou to your successful rival when driven insane by jealousy you must\nmeet him face to face, who will turn you over to his absolute mercy.\nWhy not? This final tableau doesn't please you so well?\"\n\nI looked at Wanda frightened.\n\n\"You surpass my dreams.\"\n\n\"Yes, we women are inventive,\" she said, \"take heed, when you find\nyour ideal, it might easily happen, that she will treat you more\ncruelly than you anticipate.\"\n\n\"I am afraid that I have already found my ideal!\" I exclaimed,\nburying my burning face in her lap.\n\n\"Not I?\" exclaimed Wanda, throwing off her furs and moving about the\nroom laughing. She was still laughing as I went downstairs, and when\nI stood musing in the yard, I still heard her peals of laughter above.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Do you really then expect me to embody your ideal?\" Wanda asked\narchly, when we met in the park to-day.\n\nAt first I could find no answer. The most antagonistic emotions were\nbattling within me. In the meantime she sat down on one of the\nstone-benches, and played with a flower.\n\n\"Well--am I?\"\n\nI kneeled down and seized her hands.\n\n\"Once more I beg you to become my wife, my true and loyal wife; if\nyou can't do that then become the embodiment of my ideal, absolutely,\nwithout reservation, without softness.\"\n\n\"You know I am ready at the end of a year to give you my hand, if\nyou prove to be the man I am seeking,\" Wanda replied very seriously,\n\"but I think you would be more grateful to me if through me you\nrealized your imaginings. Well, which do you prefer?\"\n\n\"I believe that everything my imagination has dreamed lies latent in\nyour personality.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken.\"\n\n\"I believe,\" I continued, \"that you enjoy having a man wholly in\nyour power, torturing him--\"\n\n\"No, no,\" she exclaimed quickly, \"or perhaps--.\" She pondered.\n\n\"I don't understand myself any longer,\" she continued, \"but I have\na confession to make to you. You have corrupted my imagination and\ninflamed my blood. I am beginning to like the things you speak of.\nThe enthusiasm with which you speak of a Pompadour, a Catherine the\nSecond, and all the other selfish, frivolous, cruel women, carries\nme away and takes hold of my soul. It urges me on to become like those\nwomen, who in spite of their vileness were slavishly adored during\ntheir lifetime and still exert a miraculous power from their graves.\n\n\"You will end by making of me a despot in miniature, a domestic\nPompadour.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" I said in agitation, \"if all this is inherent in you,\ngive way to this trend of your nature. Nothing half-way. If you can't\nbe a true and loyal wife to me, be a demon.\"\n\nI was nervous from loss of sleep, and the proximity of the beautiful\nwoman affected me like a fever. I no longer recall what I said, but\nI remember that I kissed her feet, and finally raised her foot and\nput my neck under it. She withdrew it quickly, and rose almost angrily.\n\n\"If you love me, Severin,\" she said quickly, and her voice sounded\nsharp and commanding, \"never speak to me of those things again.\nUnderstand, never! Otherwise I might really--\" She smiled and sat\ndown again.\n\n\"I am entirely serious,\" I exclaimed, half-raving. \"I adore you so\ninfinitely that I am willing to suffer anything from you, for the\nsake of spending my whole life near you.\"\n\n\"Severin, once more I warn you.\"\n\n\"Your warning is vain. Do with me what you will, as long as you\ndon't drive me away.\"\n\n\"Severin,\" replied Wanda, \"I am a frivolous young woman; it is\ndangerous for you to put yourself so completely in my power. You will\nend by actually becoming a plaything to me. Who will give warrant\nthat I shall not abuse your insane desire?\"\n\n\"Your own nobility of character.\"\n\n\"Power makes people over-bearing.\"\n\n\"Be it,\" I cried, \"tread me underfoot.\"\n\nWanda threw her arms around my neck, looked into my eyes, and shook\nher head.\n\n\"I am afraid I can't, but I will try, for your sake, for I love you\nSeverin, as I have loved no other man.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nTo-day she suddenly took her hat and shawl, and I had to go shopping\nwith her. She looked at whips, long whips with a short handle, the\nkind that are used on dogs.\n\n\"Are these satisfactory?\" said the shopkeeper.\n\n\"No, they are much too small,\" replied Wanda, with a side-glance at\nme. \"I need a large--\"\n\n\"For a bull-dog, I suppose?\" opined the merchant.\n\n\"Yes,\" she exclaimed, \"of the kind that are used in Russia for\nintractable slaves.\"\n\nShe looked further and finally selected a whip, at whose sight I\nfelt a strange creeping sensation.\n\n\"Now good-by, Severin,\" she said. \"I have some other purchases to\nmake, but you can't go along.\"\n\nI left her and took a walk. On the way back I saw Wanda coming out\nat a furrier's. She beckoned me.\n\n\"Consider it well,\" she began in good spirits, \"I have never made a\nsecret of how deeply your serious, dreamy character has fascinated\nme. The idea of seeing this serious man wholly in my power, actually\nlying enraptured at my feet, of course, stimulates me--but will this\nattraction last? Woman loves a man; she maltreats a slave, and ends\nby kicking him aside.\"\n\n\"Very well then, kick me aside,\" I replied, \"when you are tired of\nme. I want to be your slave.\"\n\n\"Dangerous forces lie within me,\" said Wanda, after we had gone a\nfew steps further. \"You awaken them, and not to your advantage. You\nknow how to paint pleasure, cruelty, arrogance in glowing colors.\nWhat would you say should I try my hand at them, and make you the\nfirst object of my experiments. I would be like Dionysius who had the\ninventor of the iron ox roasted within it in order to see whether his\nwails and groans really resembled the bellowing of an ox.\n\n\"Perhaps I am a female Dionysius?\"\n\n\"Be it,\" I exclaimed, \"and my dreams will be fulfilled. I am yours\nfor good or evil, choose. The destiny that lies concealed within my\nbreast drives me on--demoniacally--relentlessly.\"\n\n\"My Beloved,\n\nI do not care to see you to-day or to-morrow, and not until evening\nthe day after tomorrow, and then _as my slave_.\n\nYour mistress\n\nWanda.\"\n\n\"As my slave\" was underlined. I read the note which I received early\nin the morning a second time. Then I had a donkey saddled, an animal\nsymbolic of learned professors, and rode into the mountains. I wanted\nto numb my desire, my yearning, with the magnificent scenery of the\nCarpathians. I am back, tired, hungry, thirsty, and more in love than\never. I quickly change my clothes, and a few moments later knock at\nher door.\n\n\"Come in!\"\n\nI enter. She is standing in the center of the room, dressed in a gown\nof white satin which floods down her body like light. Over it she\nwears a scarlet _kazabaika_, richly edged with ermine. Upon her\npowdered, snowy hair is a little diadem of diamonds. She stands with\nher arms folded across her breast, and with her brows contracted.\n\n\"Wanda!\" I run toward her, and am about to throw my arm about her to\nkiss her. She retreats a step, measuring me from top to bottom.\n\n\"Slave!\"\n\n\"Mistress!\" I kneel down, and kiss the hem of her garment.\n\n\"That is as it should be.\"\n\n\"Oh, how beautiful you are.\"\n\n\"Do I please you?\" She stepped before the mirror, and looked at\nherself with proud satisfaction.\n\n\"I shall become mad!\"\n\nHer lower lip twitched derisively, and she looked at me mockingly\nfrom behind half-closed lids.\n\n\"Give me the whip.\"\n\nI looked about the room.\n\n\"No,\" she exclaimed, \"stay as you are, kneeling.\" She went over to\nthe fire-place, took the whip from the mantle-piece, and, watching\nme with a smile, let it hiss through the air; then she slowly rolled\nup the sleeve of her fur-jacket.\n\n\"Marvellous woman!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Silence, slave!\" She suddenly scowled, looked savage, and struck me\nwith the whip. A moment later she threw her arm tenderly about me, and\npityingly bent down to me. \"Did I hurt you?\" she asked, half-shyly,\nhalf-timidly.\n\n\"No,\" I replied, \"and even if you had, pains that come through you\nare a joy. Strike again, if it gives you pleasure.\"\n\n\"But it doesn't give me pleasure.\"\n\nAgain I was seized with that strange intoxication.\n\n\"Whip me,\" I begged, \"whip me without mercy.\"\n\nWanda swung the whip, and hit me twice. \"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Seriously, no?\"\n\n\"Whip me, I beg you, it is a joy to me.\"\n\n\"Yes, because you know very well that it isn't serious,\" she\nreplied, \"because I haven't the heart to hurt you. This brutal game\ngoes against my grain. Were I really the woman who beats her slaves\nyou would be horrified.\"\n\n\"No, Wanda,\" I replied, \"I love you more than myself; I am devoted\nto you for death and life. In all seriousness, you can do with me\nwhatever you will, whatever your caprice suggests.\"\n\n\"Severin!\"\n\n\"Tread me underfoot!\" I exclaimed, and flung myself face to the\nfloor before her.\n\n\"I hate all this play-acting,\" said Wanda impatiently.\n\n\"Well, then maltreat me seriously.\"\n\nAn uncanny pause.\n\n\"Severin, I warn you for the last time,\" began Wanda.\n\n\"If you love me, be cruel towards me,\" I pleaded with upraised eyes.\n\n\"If I love you,\" repeated Wanda. \"Very well!\" She stepped back and\nlooked at me with a sombre smile. _\"Be then my slave, and know what\nit means to be delivered into the hands of a woman.\"_ And at the\nsame moment she gave me a kick.\n\n\"How do you like that, slave?\"\n\nThen she flourished the whip.\n\n\"Get up!\"\n\nI was about to rise.\n\n\"Not that way,\" she commanded, \"on your knees.\"\n\nI obeyed, and she began to apply the lash.\n\nThe blows fell rapidly and powerfully on my back and arms. Each one\ncut into my flesh and burned there, but the pains enraptured me. They\ncame from her whom I adored, and for whom I was ready at any hour to\nlay down my life.\n\nShe stopped. \"I am beginning to enjoy it,\" she said, \"but enough for\nto-day. I am beginning to feel a demonic curiosity to see how far\nyour strength goes. I take a cruel joy in seeing you tremble and\nwrithe beneath my whip, and in hearing your groans and wails; I want\nto go on whipping without pity until you beg for mercy, until you\nlose your senses. You have awakened dangerous elements in my being.\nBut now get up.\"\n\nI seized her hand to press it to my lips.\n\n\"What impudence.\"\n\nShe shoved me away with her foot.\n\n\"Out of my sight, slave!\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter having spent a feverish night filled with confused dreams, I\nawoke. Dawn was just beginning to break.\n\nHow much of what was hovering in my memory was true; what had I\nactually experienced and what had I dreamed? That I had been whipped\nwas certain. I can still feel each blow, and count the burning red\nstripes on my body. And _she_ whipped me. Now I know everything.\n\nMy dream has become truth. How does it make me feel? Am I\ndisappointed in the realization of my dream?\n\nNo, I am merely somewhat tired, but her cruelty has enraptured me.\nOh, how I love her, adore her! All this cannot express in the\nremotest way my feeling for her, my complete devotion to her. What\nhappiness to be her slave!\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe calls to me from her balcony. I hurry upstairs. She is standing\non the threshold, holding out her hand in friendly fashion. \"I am\nashamed of myself,\" she says, while I embrace her, and she hides her\nhead against my breast.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Please try to forget the ugly scene of yesterday,\" she said with\nquivering voice, \"I have fulfilled your mad wish, now let us be\nreasonable and happy and love each other, and in a year I will be\nyour wife.\"\n\n\"My mistress,\" I exclaimed, \"and I your slave!\"\n\n\"Not another word of slavery, cruelty, or the whip,\" interrupted\nWanda. \"I shall not grant you any of those favors, none except\nwearing my fur-jacket; come and help me into it.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe little bronze clock on which stood a cupid who had just shot his\nbolt struck midnight.\n\nI rose, and wanted to leave.\n\nWanda said nothing, but embraced me and drew me back on the ottoman.\nShe began to kiss me anew, and this silent language was so\ncomprehensible, so convincing--\n\nAnd it told me more than I dared to understand.\n\nA languid abandonment pervaded Wanda's entire being. What a\nvoluptuous softness there was in the gloaming of her half-closed\neyes, in the red flood of her hair which shimmered faintly under the\nwhite powder, in the red and white satin which crackled about her\nwith every movement, in the swelling ermine of the _kazabaika_\nin which she carelessly nestled.\n\n\"Please,\" I stammered, \"but you will be angry with me.\"\n\n\"Do with me what you will,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Well, then whip me, or I shall go mad.\"\n\n\"Haven't I forbidden you,\" said Wanda sternly, \"but you are\nincorrigible.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am so terribly in love.\" I had sunken on my knees, and was\nburying my glowing face in her lap.\n\n\"I really believe,\" said Wanda thoughtfully, \"that your madness is\nnothing but a demonic, unsatisfied sensuality. _Our unnatural way\nof life must generate such illnesses._ Were you less virtuous, you\nwould be completely sane.\"\n\n\"Well then, make me sane,\" I murmured. My hands were running through\nher hair and playing tremblingly with the gleaming fur, which rose\nand fell like a moonlit wave upon her heaving bosom, and drove all\nmy senses into confusion.\n\nAnd I kissed her. No, she kissed me savagely, pitilessly, as if she\nwanted to slay me with her kisses. I was as in a delirium, and had\nlong since lost my reason, but now I, too, was breathless. I sought\nto free myself.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Wanda.\n\n\"I am suffering agonies.\"\n\n\"You are suffering--\" she broke out into a loud amused laughter.\n\n\"You laugh!\" I moaned, \"have you no idea--\"\n\nShe was serious all of a sudden. She raised my head in her hands,\nand with a violent gesture drew me to her breast.\n\n\"Wanda,\" I stammered.\n\n\"Of course, you enjoy suffering,\" she said, and laughed again, \"but\nwait, I'll bring you to your senses.\"\n\n\"No, I will no longer ask,\" I exclaimed, \"whether you want to belong\nto me for always or for only a brief moment of intoxication. I want\nto drain my happiness to the full. You are mine now, and I would\nrather lose you than never to have had you.\"\n\n\"Now you are sensible,\" she said. She kissed me again with her\nmurderous lips. I tore the ermine apart and the covering of lace and\nher naked breast surged against mine.\n\nThen my senses left me--\n\nThe first thing I remember is the moment when I saw blood dripping\nfrom my hand, and she asked apathetically: \"Did you scratch me?\"\n\n\"No, I believe, I have bitten you.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is strange how every relation in life assumes a different face as\nsoon as a new person enters.\n\nWe spent marvellous days together; we visited the mountains and\nlakes, we read together, and I completed Wanda's portrait. And how\nwe loved one another, how beautiful her smiling face was!\n\nThen a friend of hers arrived, a divorced woman somewhat older, more\nexperienced, and less scrupulous than Wanda. Her influence is already\nmaking itself felt in every direction.\n\nWanda wrinkles her brows, and displays a certain impatience with me.\n\nHas she ceased loving me?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFor almost a fortnight this unbearable restraint has lain upon us.\nHer friend lives with her, and we are never alone. A circle of men\nsurrounds the young women. With my seriousness and melancholy I am\nplaying an absurd role as lover. Wanda treats me like a stranger.\n\nTo-day, while out walking, she staid behind with me. I saw that this\nwas done intentionally, and I rejoiced. But what did she tell me?\n\n\"My friend doesn't understand how I can love you. She doesn't think\nyou either handsome or particularly attractive otherwise. She is\ntelling me from morning till night about the glamour of the frivolous\nlife in the capital, hinting at the advantages to which I could lay\nclaim, the large parties which I would find there, and the\ndistinguished and handsome admirers which I would attract. But of\nwhat use is all this, since it happens that I love you.\"\n\nFor a moment I lost my breath, then I said: \"I have no wish to stand\nin the way of your happiness, Wanda. Do not consider me.\" Then I\nraised my hat, and let her go ahead. She looked at me surprised, but\ndid not answer a syllable.\n\nWhen by chance I happened to be close to her on the way back, she\nsecretly pressed my hand. Her glance was so radiant, so full of\npromised happiness, that in a moment all the torments of these days\nwere forgotten and all their wounds healed.\n\nI now am aware again of how much I love her.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"My friend has complained about you,\" said Wanda to-day.\n\n\"Perhaps she feels that I despise her.\"\n\n\"But why do you despise her, you foolish young man?\" exclaimed\nWanda, pulling my ears with both hands.\n\n\"Because she is a hypocrite,\" I said. \"I respect only a woman who is\nactually virtuous, or who openly lives for pleasure's sake.\"\n\n\"Like me, for instance,\" replied Wanda jestingly, \"but you see,\nchild, a woman can only do that in the rarest cases. She can neither\nbe as gaily sensual, nor as spiritually free as man; her state is\nalways a mixture of the sensual and spiritual. Her heart desires to\nenchain man permanently, while she herself is ever subject to the\ndesire for change. The result is a conflict, and thus usually against\nher wishes lies and deception enter into her actions and personality\nand corrupt her character.\"\n\n\"Certainly that is true,\" I said. \"The transcendental character with\nwhich woman wants to stamp love leads her to deception.\"\n\n\"But the world likewise demands it,\" Wanda interrupted. \"Look at\nthis woman. She has a husband and a lover in Lemberg and has found\na new admirer here. She deceives all three and yet is honored by all\nand respected by the world.\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" I exclaimed, \"but she is to leave you alone; she\ntreats you like an article of commerce.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" the beautiful woman interrupted vivaciously. \"Every woman\nhas the instinct or desire to draw advantage out of her attractions,\nand much is to be said for giving one's self without love or pleasure\nbecause if you do it in cold blood, you can reap profit to best\nadvantage.\"\n\n\"Wanda, what are you saying?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" she said, \"and take note of what I am about to say to you.\n_Never feel secure with the woman you love,_ for there are more\ndangers in woman's nature than you imagine. Women are neither as\n_good_ as their admirers and defenders maintain, nor as _bad_ as their\nenemies make them out to be. _Woman's character is characterlessness._\nThe best woman will momentarily go down into the mire, and the worst\nunexpectedly rises to deeds of greatness and goodness and puts to\nshame those that despise her. No woman is so good or so bad, but that\nat any moment she is capable of the most diabolical as well as of the\nmost divine, of the filthiest as well as of the purest, thoughts,\nemotions, and actions. In spite of all the advances of civilization,\nwoman has remained as she came out of the hand of nature. She has the\nnature of a savage, who is faithful or faithless, magnanimous or\ncruel, according to the impulse that dominates at the moment.\nThroughout history it has always been a serious deep culture which has\nproduced moral character. Man even when he is selfish or evil always\nfollows _principles,_ woman never follows anything but _impulses._\nDon't ever forget that, and never feel secure with the woman you\nlove.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nHer friend has left. At last an evening alone with her again. It\nseems as if Wanda had saved up all the love, which had been kept from\nher, for this superlative evening; never had she been so kind, so\nnear, so full of tenderness.\n\nWhat happiness to cling to her lips, and to die away in her arms! In\na state of relaxation and wholly mine, her head rests against my\nbreast, and with drunken rapture our eyes seek each other.\n\nI cannot yet believe, comprehend, that this woman is mine, wholly\nmine.\n\n\"She is right on one point,\" Wanda began, without moving, without\nopening her eyes, as if she were asleep.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\nShe remained silent.\n\n\"Your friend?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Yes, she is right, you are not a man, you are a\ndreamer, a charming cavalier, and you certainly would be a priceless\nslave, but I cannot imagine you as husband.\"\n\nI was frightened.\n\n\"What is the matter? You are trembling?\"\n\n\"I tremble at the thought of how easily I might lose you,\" I replied.\n\n\"Are you made less happy now, because of this?\" she replied. \"Does\nit rob you of any of your joys, that I have belonged to another\nbefore I did to you, that others after you will possess me, and would\nyou enjoy less if another were made happy simultaneously with you?\"\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"You see,\" she continued, \"that would be a way out. You won't ever\nlose me then. I care deeply for you and intellectually we are\nharmonious, and I should like to live with you always, if in addition\nto you I might have--\"\n\n\"What an idea,\" I cried. \"You fill me with a sort of horror.\"\n\n\"Do you love me any the less?\"\n\n\"On the contrary.\"\n\nWanda had raised herself on her left arm. \"I believe,\" she said,\n\"that to hold a man permanently, it is vitally important not to be\nfaithful to him. What honest woman has ever been as devotedly loved\nas a hetaira?\"\n\n\"There is a painful stimulus in the unfaithfulness of a beloved\nwoman. It is the highest kind of ecstacy.\"\n\n\"For you, too?\" Wanda asked quickly.\n\n\"For me, too.\"\n\n\"And if I should give you that pleasure,\" Wanda exclaimed mockingly.\n\n\"I shall suffer terrible agonies, but I shall adore you the more,\"\nI replied. \"But you would never deceive me, you would have the daemonic\ngreatness of saying to me: I shall love no one but you, but I shall\nmake happy whoever pleases me.\"\n\nWanda shook her head. \"I don't like deception, I am honest, but what\nman exists who can support the burden of truth. Were I say to you:\nthis serene, sensual life, this paganism is my ideal, would you be\nstrong enough to bear it?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I could endure anything so as not to lose you. I feel\nhow little I really mean to you.\"\n\n\"But Severin--\"\n\n\"But it is so,\" said I, \"and just for that reason--\"\n\n\"For that reason you would--\" she smiled roguishly--\"have I guessed\nit?\"\n\n\"Be your slave!\" I exclaimed. \"Be your unrestricted property,\nwithout a will of my own, of which you could dispose as you wished,\nand which would therefore never be a burden to you. While you drink\nlife at its fullness, while surrounded by luxury, you enjoy the\nserene happiness and Olympian love, I want to be your servant, put\non and take off your shoes.\"\n\n\"You really aren't so far from wrong,\" replied Wanda, \"for only as\nmy slave could you endure my loving others. Furthermore the freedom\nof enjoyment of the ancient world is unthinkable without slavery. It\nmust give one a feeling of like unto a god to see a man kneel before\none and tremble. I want a slave, do you hear, Severin?\"\n\n\"Am I not your slave?\"\n\n\"Then listen to me,\" said Wanda excitedly, seizing my hand. \"I want\nto be yours, as long as I love you.\"\n\n\"A month?\"\n\n\"Perhaps, even two.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Then you become my slave.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"I? Why do you ask? I am a goddess and sometimes I descend from my\nOlympian heights to you, softly, very softly, and secretly.\n\n\"But what does all this mean,\" said Wanda, resting her head in both\nhands with her gaze lost in the distance, \"a golden fancy which never\ncan become true.\" An uncanny brooding melancholy seemed shed over her\nentire being; I have never seen her like that.\n\n\"Why unachievable?\" I began.\n\n\"Because slavery doesn't exist any longer.\"\n\n\"Then we will go to a country where it still exists, to the Orient,\nto Turkey,\" I said eagerly.\n\n\"You would--Severin--in all seriousness,\" Wanda replied. Her eyes\nburned.\n\n\"Yes, in all seriousness, I want to be your slave,\" I continued. \"I\nwant your power over me to be sanctified by law; I want my life to\nbe in your hands, I want nothing that could protect or save me from\nyou. Oh, what a voluptuous joy when once I feel myself entirely dependent\nupon your absolute will, your whim, at your beck and call. And then\nwhat happiness, when at some time you deign to be gracious, and the\nslave may kiss the lips which mean life and death to him.\" I knelt\ndown, and leaned my burning forehead against her knee.\n\n\"You are talking as in a fever,\" said Wanda agitatedly, \"and you\nreally love me so endlessly.\" She held me to her breast, and covered\nme with kisses.\n\n\"You really want it?\"\n\n\"I swear to you now by God and my honor, that I shall be your slave,\nwherever and whenever you wish it, as soon as you command,\" I\nexclaimed, hardly master of myself.\n\n\"And if I take you at your word?\" said Wanda.\n\n\"Please do!\"\n\n\"All this appeals to me,\" she said then. \"It is different from\nanything else--to know that a man who worships me, and whom I love\nwith all my heart, is so wholly mine, dependent on my will and\ncaprice, my possession and slave, while I--\"\n\nShe looked strangely at me.\n\n\"If I should become frightfully frivolous you are to blame,\" she\ncontinued. \"It almost seems as if you were afraid of me already, but\nyou have sworn.\"\n\n\"And I shall keep my oath.\"\n\n\"I shall see to that,\" she replied. \"I am beginning to enjoy it,\nand, heaven help me, we won't stick to fancies now. You shall become\nmy slave, and I--I shall try to be _Venus in Furs_.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI thought that at last I knew this woman, understood her, and now I\nsee I have to begin at the very beginning again. Only a little while\nago her reaction to my dreams was violently hostile, and now she\ntries to carry them into execution with the soberest seriousness.\n\nShe has drawn up a contract according to which I give my word of\nhonor and agree under oath to be her slave, as long as she wishes.\n\nWith her arm around my neck she reads this, unprecedented,\nincredible document to me. The end of each sentence she punctuates\nwith a kiss.\n\n\"But all the obligations in the contract are on my side,\" I said,\nteasing her.\n\n\"Of course,\" she replied with great seriousness, \"you cease to be my\nlover, and consequently I am released from all duties and obligations\ntowards you. You will have to look upon my favors as pure\nbenevolence. You no longer have any rights, and no longer can lay\nclaim to any. There can be no limit to my power over you. Remember,\nthat you won't be much better than a dog, or some inanimate object.\nYou will be mine, my plaything, which I can break to pieces, whenever\nI want an hour's amusement. You are nothing, I am everything. Do you\nunderstand?\" She laughed and kissed me again, and yet a sort of cold\nshiver ran through me.\n\n\"Won't you allow me a few conditions--\" I began.\n\n\"Conditions?\" She contracted her forehead. \"Ah! You are afraid\nalready, or perhaps you regret, but it is too late now. You have\nsworn, I have your word of honor. But let me hear them.\"\n\n\"First of all I should like to have it included in our contract,\nthat you will never completely leave me, and then that you will never\ngive me over to the mercies of any of your admirers--\"\n\n\"But Severin,\" exclaimed Wanda with her voice full of emotion and\nwith tears in her eyes, \"how can you imagine that I--and you, a man\nwho loves me so absolutely, who puts himself so entirely in my power--\"\nShe halted.\n\n\"No, no!\" I said, covering her hands with kisses. \"I don't fear\nanything from you that might dishonor me. Forgive me the ugly\nthought.\"\n\nWanda smiled happily, leaned her cheek against mine, and seemed to\nreflect.\n\n\"You have forgotten something,\" she whispered coquettishly, \"the\nmost important thing!\"\n\n\"A condition?\"\n\n\"Yes, that I must always wear my furs,\" exclaimed Wanda. \"But I\npromise you I'll do that anyhow because they give me a despotic\nfeeling. And I shall be very cruel to you, do you understand?\"\n\n\"Shall I sign the contract?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Wanda. \"I shall first add your conditions, and the\nactual signing won't occur until the proper time and place.\"\n\n\"In Constantinople?\"\n\n\"No. I have thought things over. What special value would there be\nin owning a slave where everyone owns slaves. What I want is to\n_have a slave, I alone,_ here in our civilized sober, Philistine\nworld, and a slave who submits helplessly to my power solely on\naccount of my beauty and personality, not because of law, of property\nrights, or compulsions. This attracts me. But at any rate we will go\nto a country where we are not known and where you can appear before\nthe world as my servant without embarrassment. Perhaps to Italy, to\nRome or Naples.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were sitting on Wanda's ottoman. She wore her ermine jacket, her\nhair was loose and fell like a lion's mane down her back. She clung\nto my lips, drawing my soul from my body. My head whirled, my blood\nbegan to seethe, my heart beat violently against hers.\n\n\"I want to be absolutely in your power, Wanda,\" I exclaimed\nsuddenly, seized by that frenzy of passion when I can scarcely think\nclearly or decide freely. \"I want to put myself absolutely at your\nmercy for good or evil without any condition, without any limit to\nyour power.\"\n\nWhile saying this I had slipped from the ottoman, and lay at her\nfeet looking up at her with drunken eyes.\n\n\"How beautiful you now are,\" she exclaimed, \"your eyes half-broken\nin ecstacy fill me with joy, carry me away. How wonderful your look\nwould be if you were being beaten to death, in the extreme agony. You\nhave the eye of a martyr.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nSometimes, nevertheless, I have an uneasy feeling about placing\nmyself so absolutely, so unconditionally into a woman's hands.\nSuppose she did abuse my passion, her power?\n\nWell, then I would experience what has occupied my imagination since\nmy childhood, what has always given me the feeling of seductive\nterror. A foolish apprehension! It will be a wanton game she will play\nwith me, nothing more. She loves me, and she is good, a noble\npersonality, incapable of a breach of faith. But it lies in her hands\n--_if she wants to she can._ What a temptation in this doubt, this\nfear!\n\nNow I understand Manon l'Escault and the poor chevalier, who, even\nin the pillory, while she was another man's mistress, still adored\nher.\n\nLove knows no virtue, no profit; it loves and forgives and suffers\neverything, because it must. It is not our judgment that leads us;\nit is neither the advantages nor the faults which we discover, that\nmake us abandon ourselves, or that repel us.\n\nIt is a sweet, soft, enigmatic power that drives us on. We cease to\nthink, to feel, to will; we let ourselves be carried away by it, and\nask not whither?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nA Russian prince made his first appearance today on the promenade.\nHe aroused general interest on account of his athletic figure,\nmagnificent face, and splendid bearing. The women particularly gaped\nat him as though he were a wild animal, but he went his way gloomily\nwithout paying attention to any one. He was accompanied by two\nservants, one a negro, completely dressed in red satin, and the other\na Circassian in his full gleaming uniform. Suddenly he saw Wanda, and\nfixed his cold piercing look upon her; he even turned his head after\nher, and when she had passed, he stood still and followed her with\nhis eyes.\n\nAnd she--she veritably devoured him with her radiant green eyes--and\ndid everything possible to meet him again.\n\nThe cunning coquetry with which she walked, moved, and looked at\nhim, almost stifled me. On the way home I remarked about it. She knit\nher brows.\n\n\"What do you want,\" she said, \"the prince is a man whom I might\nlike, who even dazzles me, and I am free. I can do what I please--\"\n\n\"Don't you love me any longer--\" I stammered, frightened.\n\n\"I love only you,\" she replied, \"but I shall have the prince pay\ncourt to me.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"Aren't you my slave?\" she said calmly. \"Am I not Venus, the cruel\nnorthern Venus in Furs?\"\n\nI was silent. I felt literally crushed by her words; her cold look\nentered my heart like a dagger.\n\n\"You will find out immediately the prince's name, residence, and\ncircumstances,\" she continued. \"Do you understand?\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"No argument, obey!\" exclaimed Wanda, more sternly than I would have\nthought possible for her, \"and don't dare to enter my sight until you\ncan answer my questions.\"\n\nIt was not till afternoon that I could obtain the desired\ninformation for Wanda. She let me stand before her like a servant,\nwhile she leaned back in her arm-chair and listened to me, smiling.\nThen she nodded; she seemed to be satisfied.\n\n\"Bring me my footstool,\" she commanded shortly.\n\nI obeyed, and after having put it before her and having put her feet\non it, I remained kneeling.\n\n\"How will this end?\" I asked sadly after a short pause.\n\nShe broke into playful laughter. \"Why things haven't even begun yet.\"\n\n\"You are more heartless than I imagined,\" I replied, hurt.\n\n\"Severin,\" Wanda began earnestly. \"I haven't done anything yet, not\nthe slightest thing, and you are already calling me heartless. What\nwill happen when I begin to carry your dreams to their realization,\nwhen I shall lead a gay, free life and have a circle of admirers\nabout me, when I shall actually fulfil your ideal, tread you\nunderfoot and apply the lash?\"\n\n\"You take my dreams too seriously.\"\n\n\"Too seriously? I can't stop at make-believe, when once I begin,\"\nshe replied. \"You know I hate all play-acting and comedy. You have\nwished it. Was it my idea or yours? Did I persuade you or did you\ninflame my imagination? I am taking things seriously now.\"\n\n\"Wanda,\" I replied, caressingly, \"listen quietly to me. We love each\nother infinitely, we are very happy, will you sacrifice our entire\nfuture to a whim?\"\n\n\"It is no longer a whim,\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked frightened.\n\n\"Something that was probably latent in me,\" she said quietly and\nthoughtfully. \"Perhaps it would never have come to light, if you had\nnot called it to life, and made it grow. Now that it has become a\npowerful impulse, fills my whole being, now that I enjoy it, now that\nI cannot and do not want to do otherwise, now you want to back out--\nyou--are you a man?\"\n\n\"Dear, sweet Wanda!\" I began to caress her, kiss her.\n\n\"Don't--you are not a man--\"\n\n\"And you,\" I flared up.\n\n\"I am stubborn,\" she said, \"you know that. I haven't a strong\nimagination, and like you I am weak in execution. But when I make up\nmy mind to do something, I carry it through, and the more certainly,\nthe more opposition I meet. Leave me alone!\"\n\nShe pushed me away, and got up.\n\n\"Wanda!\" I likewise rose, and stood facing her.\n\n\"Now you know what I am,\" she continued. \"Once more I warn you. You\nstill have the choice. I am not compelling you to be my slave.\"\n\n\"Wanda,\" I replied with emotion and tears filling my eyes, \"don't\nyou know how I love you?\"\n\nHer lips quivered contemptuously.\n\n\"You are mistaken, you make yourself out worse than you are; you are\ngood and noble by nature--\"\n\n\"What do you know about my nature,\" she interrupted vehemently, \"you\nwill get to know me as I am.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"Decide, will you submit, unconditionally?\"\n\n\"And if I say no.\"\n\n\"Then--\"\n\nShe stepped close up to me, cold and contemptuous. As she stood\nbefore me now, the arms folded across her breast, with an evil smile\nabout her lips, she was in fact the despotic woman of my dreams. Her\nexpression seemed hard, and nothing lay in her eyes that promised\nkindness or mercy.\n\n\"Well--\" she said at last.\n\n\"You are angry,\" I cried, \"you will punish me.\"\n\n\"Oh no!\" she replied, \"I shall let you go. You are free. I am not\nholding you.\"\n\n\"Wanda--I, who love you so--\"\n\n\"Yes, you, my dear sir, you who adore me,\" she exclaimed\ncontemptuously, \"but who are a coward, a liar, and a breaker of\npromises. Leave me instantly--\"\n\n\"Wanda I--\"\n\n\"Wretch!\"\n\nMy blood rose in my heart. I threw myself down at her feet and began\nto cry.\n\n\"Tears, too!\" She began to laugh. Oh, this laughter was frightful.\n\"Leave me--I don't want to see you again.\"\n\n\"Oh my God!\" I cried, beside myself. \"I will do whatever you\ncommand, be your slave, a mere object with which you can do what you\nwill--only don't send me away--I can't bear it--I cannot live without\nyou.\" I embraced her knees, and covered her hand with kisses.\n\n\"Yes, you must be a slave, and feel the lash, for you are not a\nman,\" she said calmly. She said this to me with perfect composure,\nnot angrily, not even excitedly, and it was what hurt most. \"Now I\nknow you, your dog-like nature, that adores where it is kicked, and\nthe more, the more it is maltreated. Now I know you, and now you\nshall come to know me.\"\n\nShe walked up and down with long strides, while I remained crushed\non my knees; my head was hanging supine, tears flowed from my eyes.\n\n\"Come here,\" Wanda commanded harshly, sitting down on the ottoman.\nI obeyed her command, and sat down beside her. She looked at me\nsombrely, and then a light suddenly seemed to illuminate the interior\nof her eye. Smiling, she drew me toward her breast, and began to kiss\nthe tears out of my eyes.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe odd part of my situation is that I am like the bear in Lily's\npark. I can escape and don't want to; I am ready to endure everything\nas soon as she threatens to set me free.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIf only she would use the whip again. There is something uncanny in\nthe kindness with which she treats me. I seem like a little captive\nmouse with which a beautiful cat prettily plays. She is ready at any\nmoment to tear it to pieces, and my heart of a mouse threatens to\nburst.\n\nWhat are her intentions? What does she purpose to do with me?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seems she has completely forgotten the contract, my slavehood. Or\nwas it actually only stubbornness? And she gave up her whole plan as\nsoon as I no longer opposed her and submitted to her imperial whim?\n\nHow kind she is to me, how tender, how loving! We are spending\nmarvellously happy days.\n\nTo-day she had me read to her the scene between Faust and\nMephistopheles, in which the latter appears as a wandering scholar.\nHer glance hung on me with strange pleasure.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" she said when I had finished, \"how a man who\ncan read such great and beautiful thoughts with such expression, and\ninterpret them so clearly, concisely, and intelligently, can at the\nsame time be such a visionary and supersensual ninny as you are.\"\n\n\"Were you pleased,\" said I, and kissed her forehead.\n\nShe gently stroked my brow. \"I love you, Severin,\" she whispered. \"I\ndon't believe I could ever love any one more than you. Let us be\nsensible, what do you say?\"\n\nInstead of replying I folded her in my arms; a deep inward, yet\nvaguely sad happiness filled my breast, my eyes grew moist, and a\ntear fell upon her hand.\n\n\"How can you cry!\" she exclaimed, \"you are a child!\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nOn a pleasure drive we met the Russian prince in his carriage. He\nseemed to be unpleasantly surprised to see me by Wanda's side, and\nlooked as if he wanted to pierce her through and through with his\nelectric gray eyes. She, however, did not seem to notice him. I felt\nat that moment like kneeling down before her and kissing her feet.\nShe let her glance glide over him indifferently as though he were an\ninanimate object, a tree, for instance, and turned to me with her\ngracious smile.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I said good-night to her to-day she seemed suddenly\nunaccountably distracted and moody. What was occupying her?\n\n\"I am sorry you are going,\" she said when I was already standing on\nthe threshold.\n\n\"It is entirely in your hands to shorten the hard period of my\ntrial, to cease tormenting me--\" I pleaded.\n\n\"Do you imagine that this compulsion isn't a torment for me, too,\"\nWanda interjected.\n\n\"Then end it,\" I exclaimed, embracing her, \"be my wife.\"\n\n\"_Never, Severin_,\" she said gently, but with great firmness.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nI was frightened in my innermost soul.\n\n\"_You are not the man for me._\"\n\nI looked at her, and slowly withdrew my arm which was still about\nher waist; then I left the room, and she--she did not call me back.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nA sleepless night; I made countless decisions, only to toss them\naside again. In the morning I wrote her a letter in which I declared\nour relationship dissolved. My hand trembled when I put on the seal,\nand I burned my fingers.\n\nAs I went upstairs to hand it to the maid, my knees threatened to\ngive way.\n\nThe door opened, and Wanda thrust forth her head full of curling-papers.\n\n\"I haven't had my hair dressed yet,\" she said, smiling. \"What have\nyou there?\"\n\n\"A letter--\"\n\n\"For me?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Ah, you want to break with me,\" she exclaimed, mockingly.\n\n\"Didn't you tell me yesterday that I wasn't the man for you?\"\n\n_\"I repeat it now!\"_\n\n\"Very well, then.\" My whole body was trembling, my voice failed me,\nand I handed her the letter.\n\n\"Keep it,\" she said, measuring me coldly. \"You forget that is no\nlonger a question as to whether you satisfy me as a man; as a _slave_\nyou will doubtless do well enough.\"\n\n\"Madame!\" I exclaimed, aghast.\n\n\"That is what you will call me in the future,\" replied Wanda,\nthrowing back her head with a movement of unutterable contempt. \"Put\nyour affairs in order within the next twenty-four hours. The day\nafter to-morrow I shall start for Italy, and you will accompany me\nas my servant.\"\n\n\"Wanda--\"\n\n\"I forbid any sort of familiarity,\" she said, cutting my words short,\n\"likewise you are not to come in unless I call or ring for you, and\nyou are not to speak to me until you are spoken to. From now on your\nname is no longer Severin, but _Gregor_.\"\n\nI trembled with rage, and yet, unfortunately, I cannot deny it, I\nalso felt a strange pleasure and stimulation.\n\n\"But, madame, you know my circumstances,\" I began in my confusion.\n\"I am dependent on my father, and I doubt whether he will give me the\nlarge sum of money needed for this journey--\"\n\n\"That means you have no money, Gregor,\" said Wanda, delightedly, \"so\nmuch the better, you are then entirely dependent on me, and in fact\nmy slave.\"\n\n\"You don't consider,\" I tried to object, \"that as man of honor it is\nimpossible for me--\"\n\n\"I have indeed considered it,\" she replied almost with a tone of\ncommand. \"As a man of honor you must keep your oath and redeem your\npromise to follow me as slave whithersoever I demand and to obey\nwhatever I command. Now leave me, Gregor!\"\n\nI turned toward the door.\n\n\"Not yet--you may first kiss my hand.\" She held it out to me with a\ncertain proud indifference, and I the dilettante, the donkey, the\nmiserable slave pressed it with intense tenderness against my lips\nwhich were dry and hot with excitement.\n\nThere was another gracious nod of the head.\n\nThen I was dismissed.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThough it was late in the evening my light was still lit, and a fire\nwas burning in the large green stove. There were still many things\namong my letters and documents to be put in order. Autumn, as is\nusually the case with us, had fallen with all its power.\n\nSuddenly she knocked at my window with the handle of her whip.\n\nI opened and saw her standing outside in her ermine-lined jacket and\nin a high round Cossack cap of ermine of the kind which the great\nCatherine favored.\n\n\"Are you ready, Gregor?\" she asked darkly.\n\n\"Not yet, mistress,\" I replied.\n\n\"I like that word,\" she said then, \"you are always to call me\nmistress, do you understand? We leave here to-morrow morning at nine\no'clock. As far as the district capital you will be my companion and\nfriend, but from the moment that we enter the railway-coach you are\nmy slave, my servant. Now close the window, and open the door.\"\n\nAfter I had done as she had demanded, and after she had entered, she\nasked, contracting her brows ironically, \"well, how do you like me.\"\n\n\"Wanda, you--\"\n\n\"Who gave you permission?\" She gave me a blow with the whip.\n\n\"You are very beautiful, mistress.\"\n\nWanda smiled and sat down in the arm-chair. \"Kneel down--here beside\nmy chair.\"\n\nI obeyed.\n\n\"Kiss my hand.\"\n\nI seized her small cold hand and kissed it.\n\n\"And the mouth--\"\n\nIn a surge of passion I threw my arms around the beautiful cruel\nwoman, and covered her face, arms, and breast with glowing kisses.\nShe returned them with equal fervor--the eyelids closed as in a\ndream. It was after midnight when she left.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAt nine o'clock sharp in the morning everything was ready for departure,\nas she had ordered. We left the little Carpathian health-resort in a\ncomfortable light carriage. The most interesting drama of my life had\nreached a point of development whose denouement it was then impossible\nto foretell.\n\nSo far everything went well. I sat beside Wanda, and she chatted\nvery graciously and intelligently with me, as with a good friend,\nconcerning Italy, Pisemski's new novel, and Wagner's music. She wore\na sort of Amazonesque travelling-dress of black cloth with a short\njacket of the same material, set with dark fur. It fitted closely and\nshowed her figure to best advantage. Over it she wore dark furs. Her\nhair wound into an antique knot, lay beneath a small dark fur-hat\nfrom which a black veil hung. Wanda was in very good humor; she fed\nme candies, played with my hair, loosened my neck cloth and made a\npretty cockade of it; she covered my knees with her furs and\nstealthily pressed the fingers of my hand. When our Jewish driver\npersistently went on nodding to himself, she even gave me a kiss, and\nher cold lips had the fresh frosty fragrance of a young autumnal\nrose, which blossoms alone amid bare stalks and yellow leaves and\nupon whose calyx the first frost has hung tiny diamonds of ice.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWe are at the district capital. We get out at the railway station.\nWanda throws off her furs and places them over my arm, and goes\nto secure the tickets.\n\nWhen she returns she has completely changed.\n\n\"Here is your ticket, Gregor,\" she says in a tone which supercilious\nladies use to their servants.\n\n\"A third-class ticket,\" I reply with comic horror.\n\n\"Of course,\" she continues, \"but now be careful. You won't get on\nuntil I am settled in my compartment and don't need you any longer.\nAt each station you will hurry to my car and ask for my orders. Don't\nforget. And now give me my furs.\"\n\nAfter I had helped her into them, humbly like a slave, she went to\nfind an empty first-class coupe. I followed. Supporting herself on\nmy shoulder, she got on and I wrapped her feet in bear-skins and placed\nthem on the warming bottle.\n\nThen she nodded to me, and dismissed me. I slowly ascended a third-class\ncarriage, which was filled with abominable tobacco-smoke that seemed\nlike the fogs of Acheron at the entrance to Hades. I now had the leisure\nto muse about the riddle of human existence, and about its greatest\nriddle of all--_woman_.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWhenever the train stops, I jump off, run to her carriage, and with\ndrawn cap await her orders. She wants coffee and then a glass of\nwater, at another time a bowl of warm water to wash her hands, and\nthus it goes on. She lets several men who have entered her\ncompartment pay court to her. I am dying of jealousy and have to leap\nabout like an antelope so as to secure what she wants quickly and\nnot miss the train.\n\nIn this way the night passes. I haven't had time to eat a mouthful\nand I can't sleep, I have to breathe the same oniony air with Polish\npeasants, Jewish peddlers, and common soldiers.\n\nWhen I mount the steps of her coupe, she is lying stretched out\non cushions in her comfortable furs, covered up with the skins of\nanimals. She is like an oriental despot, and the men sit like Indian\ndeities, straight upright against the walls and scarcely dare to\nbreathe.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe stops over in Vienna for a day to go shopping, and particularly\nto buy series of luxurious gowns. She continues to treat me as her\nservant. I follow her at the respectful distance of ten paces. She\nhands me her packages without so much as even deigning a kind look,\nand laden down like a donkey I pant along behind.\n\nBefore leaving she takes all my clothes and gives them to the hotel\nwaiters. I am ordered to put on her livery. It is a Cracovian costume\nin her colors, light-blue with red facings, and red quadrangular cap,\nornamented with peacock-feathers. The costume is rather becoming to\nme.\n\nThe silver buttons bear her coat of arms. I have the feeling of having\nbeen sold or of having bonded myself to the devil. My fair demon leads\nme from Vienna to Florence. Instead of linen-garbed Mazovians and\ngreasy-haired Jews, my companions now are curly-haired Contadini, a\nmagnificent sergeant of the first Italian Grenadiers, and a poor German\npainter. The tobacco smoke no longer smells of onions, but of salami and\ncheese.\n\nNight has fallen again. I lie on my wooden bed as on a rack; my arms and\nlegs seem broken. But there nevertheless is an element of poetry in the\naffair. The stars sparkle round about, the Italian sergeant has a face\nlike Apollo Belvedere, and the German painter sings a lovely German\nsong.\n\n\"Now that all the shadows gather\nAnd endless stars grow light,\nDeep yearning on me falls\nAnd softly fills the night.\"\n\n\"Through the sea of dreams\nSailing without cease,\nSailing goes my soul\nIn thine to find release.\"\n\nAnd I am thinking of the beautiful woman who is sleeping in regal\ncomfort among her soft furs.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFlorence! Crowds, cries, importunate porters and cab-drivers. Wanda\nchooses a carriage, and dismisses the porters.\n\n\"What have I a servant for,\" she says, \"Gregor--here is the ticket--\nget the luggage.\"\n\nShe wraps herself in her furs and sits quietly in the carriage while I\ndrag the heavy trunks hither, one after another. I break down for a\nmoment under the last one; a good-natured _carabiniere_ with an\nintelligent face comes to my assistance. She laughs.\n\n\"It must be heavy,\" said she, \"all my furs are in it.\"\n\nI get up on the driver's seat, wiping drops of perspiration from my\nbrow. She gives the name of the hotel, and the driver urges on his\nhorse. In a few minutes we halt at the brilliantly illuminated\nentrance.\n\n\"Have you any rooms?\" she asks the portier.\n\n\"Yes, madame.\"\n\n\"Two for me, one for my servant, all with stoves.\"\n\n\"Two first-class rooms for you, madame, both with stoves,\" replied\nthe waiter who had hastily come up, \"and one without heat for your\nservant.\"\n\nShe looked at them, and then abruptly said: \"they are satisfactory,\nhave fires built at once; my servant can sleep in the unheated room.\"\n\nI merely looked at her.\n\n\"Bring up the trunks, Gregor,\" she commands, paying no attention to\nmy looks. \"In the meantime I'll be dressing, and then will go down\nto the dining-room, and you can eat something for supper.\"\n\nAs she goes into the adjoining room, I drag the trunks upstairs and\nhelp the waiter build a fire in her bed-room. He tries to question\nme in bad French about my employer. With a brief glance I see the\nblazing fire, the fragrant white poster-bed, and the rugs which cover\nthe floor. Tired and hungry I then descend the stairs, and ask for\nsomething to eat. A good-natured waiter, who used to be in the\nAustrian army and takes all sorts of pains to entertain me in German,\nshows me the dining-room and waits on me. I have just had the first\nfresh drink in thirty-six hours and the first bite of warm food on\nmy fork, when she enters.\n\nI rise.\n\n\"What do you mean by taking me into a dining-room in which my\nservant is eating,\" she snaps at the waiter, flaring with anger. She\nturns around and leaves.\n\nMeanwhile I thank heaven that I am permitted to go on eating. Later\nI climb the four flights upstairs to my room. My small trunk is\nalready there, and a miserable little oil-lamp is burning. It is a\nnarrow room without fire-place, without a window, but with a small\nair-hole. If it weren't so beastly cold, it would remind me of one\nof the Venetian _piombi_. [Footnote: These were notorious prisons\nunder the leaden roof of the Palace of the Doges.] Involuntarily I\nhave to laugh out aloud, so that it re-echoes, and I am startled by\nmy own laughter.\n\nSuddenly the door is pulled open and the waiter with a theatrical\nItalian gesture calls \"You are to come down to madame, at once.\" I\npick up my cap, stumble down the first few steps, but finally arrive\nin front of her door on the first floor and knock.\n\n\"Come in!\"\n\nI enter, shut the door, and stand attention.\n\nWanda has made herself comfortable. She is sitting in a neglige of\nwhite muslin and laces on a small red divan with her feet on a\nfootstool that matches. She has thrown her fur-cloak about her. It\nis the identical cloak in which she appeared to me for the first time,\nas goddess of love.\n\nThe yellow lights of the candelabra which stand on projections,\ntheir reflections in the large mirrors, and the red flames from the\nopen fireplace play beautifully on the green velvet, the dark-brown\nsable of the cloak, the smooth white skin, and the red, flaming hair\nof the beautiful woman. Her clear, but cold face is turned toward me,\nand her cold green eyes rest upon me.\n\n\"I am satisfied with you, Gregor,\" she began.\n\nI bowed.\n\n\"Come closer.\"\n\nI obeyed.\n\n\"Still closer,\" she looked down, and stroked the sable with her\nhand. \"Venus in Furs receives her slave. I can see that you are more\nthan an ordinary dreamer, you don't remain far in arrears of your\ndreams; you are the sort of man who is ready to carry his dreams into\neffect, no matter how mad they are. I confess, I like this; it\nimpresses me. There is strength in this, and strength is the only\nthing one respects. I actually believe that under unusual\ncircumstances, in a period of great deeds, what seems to be your\nweakness would reveal itself as extraordinary power. Under the early\nemperors you would have been a martyr, at the time of the Reformation\nan anabaptist, during the French Revolution one of those inspired\nGirondists who mounted the guillotine with the marseillaise on their\nlips. But you are my slave, my--\"\n\nShe suddenly leaped up; the furs slipped down, and she threw her\narms with soft pressure about my neck.\n\n\"My beloved slave, Severin, oh, how I love you, how I adore you, how\nhandsome you are in your Cracovian costume! You will be cold to-night\nup in your wretched room without a fire. Shall I give you one of my\nfurs, dear heart, the large one there--\"\n\nShe quickly picked it up, throwing it over my shoulders, and before\nI knew what had happened I was completely wrapped up in it.\n\n\"How wonderfully becoming furs are to your face, they bring out your\nnoble lines. As soon as you cease being my slave, you must wear a\nvelvet coat with sable, do you understand? Otherwise I shall never\nput on my fur-jacket again.\"\n\nAnd again she began to caress me and kiss me; finally she drew me\ndown on the little divan.\n\n\"You seem to be pleased with yourself in furs,\" she said. \"Quick,\nquick, give them to me, or I will lose all sense of dignity.\"\n\nI placed the furs about her, and Wanda slipped her right arm into\nthe sleeve.\n\n\"This is the pose in Titian's picture. But now enough of joking.\nDon't always look so solemn, it makes me feel sad. As far as the\nworld is concerned you are still merely my servant; you are not yet\nmy slave, for you have not yet signed the contract. You are still\nfree, and can leave me any moment. You have played your part\nmagnificently. I have been delighted, but aren't you tired of it\nalready, and don't you think I am abominable? Well, say something--I\ncommand it.\"\n\n\"Must I confess to you, Wanda?\" I began.\n\n\"Yes, you must.\"\n\n\"Even it you take advantage of it,\" I continued, \"I shall love you\nthe more deeply, adore you the more fanatically, the worse you treat\nme. What you have just done inflames my blood and intoxicates all my\nsenses.\" I held her close to me and clung for several moments to her\nmoist lips.\n\n\"Oh, you beautiful woman,\" I then exclaimed, looking at her. In my\nenthusiasm I tore the sable from her shoulders and pressed my mouth\nagainst her neck.\n\n\"You love me even when I am cruel,\" said Wanda, \"now go!--you bore\nme--don't you hear?\"\n\nShe boxed my ears so that I saw stars and bells rang in my ears.\n\n\"Help me into my furs, slave.\"\n\nI helped her, as well as I could.\n\n\"How awkward,\" she exclaimed, and was scarcely in it before she\nstruck me in the face again. I felt myself growing pale.\n\n\"Did I hurt you?\" she asked, softly touching me with her hand.\n\n\"No, no,\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"At any rate you have no reason to complain, you want it thus; now\nkiss me again.\"\n\nI threw my arms about her, and her lips clung closely to mine. As\nshe lay against my breast in her large heavy furs, I had a curiously\noppressive sensation. It was as if a wild beast, a she-bear, were\nembracing me. It seemed as if I were about to feel her claws in my\nflesh. But this time the she-bear let me off easily.\n\nWith my heart filled with smiling hopes, I went up to my miserable\nservant's room, and threw myself down on my hard couch.\n\n\"Life is really amazingly droll,\" I thought. \"A short time ago the\nmost beautiful woman, Venus herself, rested against your breast, and\nnow you have an opportunity for studying the Chinese hell. Unlike us,\nthey don't hurl the damned into flames, but they have devils chasing\nthem out into fields of ice.\n\n\"Very likely the founders of their religion also slept in unheated\nrooms.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the night I startled out of my sleep with a scream. I had\nbeen dreaming of an icefield in which I had lost my way; I had been\nlooking in vain for a way out. Suddenly an eskimo drove up in a\nsleigh harnessed with reindeer; he had the face of the waiter who had\nshown me to the unheated room.\n\n\"What are you looking for here, my dear sir?\" he exclaimed. \"This is\nthe North Pole.\"\n\nA moment later he had disappeared, and Wanda flew over the smooth\nice on tiny skates. Her white satin skirt fluttered and crackled; the\nermine of her jacket and cap, but especially her face, gleamed whiter\nthan the snow. She shot toward me, inclosed me in her arms, and began\nto kiss me. Suddenly I felt my blood running warm down my side.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" I asked horror-stricken.\n\nShe laughed, and as I looked at her now, it was no longer Wanda, but\na huge, white she-bear, who was digging her paws into my body.\n\nI cried out in despair, and still heard her diabolical laughter when\nI awoke, and looked about the room in surprise.\n\nEarly in the morning I stood at Wanda's door, and the waiter brought\nthe coffee. I took it from him, and served it to my beautiful\nmistress. She had already dressed, and looked magnificent, all fresh\nand roseate. She smiled graciously at me and called me back, when I\nwas about to withdraw respectfully.\n\n\"Come, Gregor, have your breakfast quickly too,\" she said, \"then we\nwill go house-hunting. I don't want to stay in the hotel any longer\nthan I have to. It is very embarassing here. If I chat with you for\nmore than a minute, people will immediately say: 'The fair Russian\nis having an affair with her servant, you see, the race of Catherines\nisn't extinct yet.'\"\n\nHalf an hour later we went out; Wanda was in her cloth-gown with the\nRussian cap, and I in my Cracovian costume. We created quite a stir. I\nwalked about ten paces behind, looking very solemn, but expected\nmomentarily to have to break out into loud laughter. There was scarcely\na street in which one or the other of the attractive houses did not bear\nthe sign _camere ammobiliate_. Wanda always sent me upstairs, and only\nwhen the apartment seemed to answer her requirements did she herself\nascend. By noon I was as tired as a stag-hound after the hunt.\n\nWe entered a new house and left it again without having found a suitable\nhabitation. Wanda was already somewhat out of humor. Suddenly she said\nto me: \"Severin, the seriousness with which you play your part is\ncharming, and the restrictions, which we have placed upon each other are\nreally annoying me. I can't stand it any longer, I do love you, I must\nkiss you. Let's go into one of the houses.\"\n\n\"But, my lady--\" I interposed.\n\n\"Gregor?\" She entered the next open corridor and ascended a few\nsteps of the dark stair-way; then she threw her arms about me with\npassionate tenderness and kissed me.\n\n\"Oh, Severin, you were very wise. You are much more dangerous as\nslave than I would have imagined; you are positively irrestible, and\nI am afraid I shall have to fall in love with you again.\"\n\n\"Don't you love me any longer then,\" I asked seized by a sudden\nfright.\n\nShe solemnly shook her head, but kissed me again with her swelling,\nadorable lips.\n\nWe returned to the hotel. Wanda had luncheon, and ordered me also\nquickly to get something to eat.\n\nOf course, I wasn't served as quickly as she, and so it happened\nthat just as I was carrying the second bite of my steak to my mouth,\nthe waiter entered and called out with his theatrical gesture:\n\"Madame wants you, at once.\"\n\nI took a rapid and painful leave of my food, and, tired and hungry,\nhurried toward Wanda, who was already on the street.\n\n\"I wouldn't have imagined you could be so cruel,\" I said\nreproachfully. \"With all these, fatiguing duties you don't even leave\nme time to eat in peace.\"\n\nWanda laughed gaily. \"I thought you had finished,\" she said, \"but\nnever mind. Man was born to suffer, and you in particular. The\nmartyrs didn't have any beefsteaks either.\"\n\nI followed her resentfully, gnawing at my hunger.\n\n\"I have given up the idea of finding a place in the city,\" Wanda\ncontinued. \"It will be difficult to find an entire floor which is\nshut off and where you can do as you please. In such a strange, mad\nrelationship as ours there must be no jarring note. I shall rent an\nentire villa--and you will be surprised. You have my permission now\nto satisfy your hunger, and look about a bit in Florence. I won't be\nhome till evening. If I need you then, I will have you called.\"\n\nI looked at the Duomo, the Palazzo Vecchio, the Logia di Lanzi, and\nthen I stood for a long time on the banks of the Arno. Again and\nagain I let my eyes rest on the magnificent ancient Florence, whose\nround cupolas and towers were drawn in soft lines against the blue,\ncloudless sky. I watched its splendid bridges beneath whose wide\narches the lively waves of the beautiful, yellow river ran, and the\ngreen hills which surrounded the city, bearing slender cypresses and\nextensive buildings, palaces and monasteries.\n\nIt is a different world, this one in which we are--a gay, sensuous,\nsmiling world. The landscape too has nothing of the seriousness and\nsomberness of ours. It is a long ways off to the last white villas\nscattered among the pale green of the mountains, and yet there isn't\na spot that isn't bright with sunlight. The people are less serious\nthan we; perhaps, they think less, but they all look as though they\nwere happy.\n\nIt is also maintained that death is easier in the South.\n\nI have a vague feeling now that such a thing as beauty without thorn\nand love of the senses without torment does exist.\n\nWanda has discovered a delightful little villa and rented it for the\nwinter. It is situated on a charming hill on the left bank of the\nArno, opposite the Cascine. It is surrounded by an attractive garden\nwith lovely paths, grass plots, and magnificent meadow of camelias.\nIt is only two stories high, quadrangular in the Italian fashion. An\nopen gallery runs along one side, a sort of loggia with plaster-casts\nof antique statues; stone steps lead from it down into the garden.\nFrom the gallery you enter a bath with a magnificent marble basin,\nfrom which winding stairs lead to my mistress' bed-chamber.\n\nWanda occupies the second story by herself.\n\nA room on the ground floor has been assigned to me; it is very\nattractive, and even has a fireplace.\n\nI have roamed through the garden. On a round hillock I discovered a\nlittle temple, but I found its door locked. However, there is a chink\nin the door and when I glue my eye to it, I see the goddess of love\non a white pedestal.\n\nA slight shudder passes over me. It seems to me as if she were\nsmiling at me saying: \"Are you there? I have been expecting you.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is evening. An attractive maid brings me orders to appear before\nmy mistress. I ascend the wide marble stairs, pass through the\nanteroom, a large salon furnished with extravagant magnificence, and\nknock at the door of the bedroom. I knock very softly for the luxury\ndisplayed everywhere intimidates me. Consequently no one hears me,\nand I stand for some time in front of the door. I have a feeling as\nif I were standing before the bed-room of the great Catherine, and\nit seems as if at any moment she might come out in her green sleeping\nfurs, with the red ribbon and decoration on her bare breast, and with\nher little white powdered curls.\n\nI knocked again. Wanda impatiently pulls the door open.\n\n\"Why so late?\" she asks.\n\n\"I was standing in front of the door, but you didn't hear me knock,\"\nI reply timidly. She closes the door, and clinging to me, she leads\nme to the red damask ottoman on which she had been resting. The\nentire arrangement of the room is in red damask--wall-paper,\ncurtains, portieres, hangings of the bed. A magnificent painting of\nSamson and Delilah forms the ceiling.\n\nWanda receives me in an intoxicating dishabille. Her white satin\ndress flows gracefully and picturesquely down her slender body,\nleaving her arms and breast bare, and carelessly they nestle amid the\ndark hair of the great fur of sable, lined with green velvet. Her red\nhair falls down her back as far as the hips, only half held by\nstrings of black pearls.\n\n\"Venus in Furs,\" I whisper, while she draws me to her breast and\nthreatens to stifle me with her kisses. Then I no longer speak and\nneither do I think; everything is drowned out in an ocean of\nunimagined bliss.\n\n\"Do you still love me?\" she asks, her eye softening in passionate\ntenderness.\n\n\"You ask!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"You still remember your oath,\" she continued with an alluring\nsmile, \"now that everything is prepared, everything in readiness, I\nask you once more, is it still your serious wish to become my slave?\"\n\n\"Am I not ready?\" I asked in surprise.\n\n\"You have not yet signed the papers.\"\n\n\"Papers--what papers?\"\n\n\"Oh, I see, you want to give it up,\" she said, \"well then, we will\nlet it go.\"\n\n\"But Wanda,\" I said, \"you know that nothing gives me greater\nhappiness than to serve you, to be your slave. I would give\neverything for the sake of feeling myself wholly in your power, even\nunto death--\"\n\n\"How beautiful you are,\" she whispered, \"when you speak so\nenthusiastically, so passionately. I am more in love with you than\never and you want me to be dominant, stern, and cruel. I am afraid,\nit will be impossible for me to be so.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid,\" I replied smiling, \"where are the papers?'\"\n\n\"So that you may know what it means to be absolutely in my power, I\nhave drafted a second agreement in which you declare that you have\ndecided to kill yourself. In that way I can even kill you, if I so\ndesire.\"\n\n\"Give them to me.\"\n\nWhile I was unfolding the documents and reading them, Wanda got pen\nand ink. She then sat down beside me with her arm about my neck, and\nlooked over my shoulder at the paper.\n\nThe first one read:\n\nAGREEMENT BETWEEN MME. VON DUNAJEW AND SEVERIN VON KUSIEMSKI\n\n\"Severin von Kusiemski ceases with the present day being the affianced\nof Mme. Wanda von Dunajew, and renounces all the rights appertaining\nthereunto; he on the contrary binds himself on his word of honor as a\nman and nobleman, that hereafter he will be her _slave_ until such\ntime that she herself sets him at liberty again.\n\n\"As the slave of Mme. von Dunajew he is to bear the name Gregor, and\nhe is unconditionally to comply with every one of her wishes, and to\nobey every one of her commands; he is always to be submissive to his\nmistress, and is to consider her every sign of favor as an\nextraordinary mercy.\n\n\"Mme. von Dunajew is entitled not only to punish her slave as she\ndeems best, even for the slightest inadvertence or fault, but also\nis herewith given the right to torture him as the mood may seize her\nor merely for the sake of whiling away the time. Should she so desire,\nshe may kill him whenever she wishes; in short, he is her\nunrestricted property.\n\n\"Should Mme. von Dunajew ever set her slave at liberty, Severin von\nKusiemski agrees to forget everything that he has experienced or\nsuffered as her slave, and promises _never under any circumstances and\nin no wise to think of vengeance or retaliation_.\n\n\"Mme. von Dunajew on her behalf agrees as his mistress to appear as\noften as possible in her furs, especially when she purposes some\ncruelty toward her slave.\"\n\nAppended at the bottom of the agreement was the date of the present\nday.\n\nThe second document contained only a few words.\n\n\"Having since many years become weary of existence and its\nillusions, I have of my own free will put an end to my worthless\nlife.\"\n\nI was seized with a deep horror when I had finished. There was still\ntime, I could still withdraw, but the madness of passion and the\nsight of the beautiful woman that lay all relaxed against my shoulder\ncarried me away.\n\n\"This one you will have to copy, Severin,\" said Wanda, indicating\nthe second document. \"It has to be entirely in your own handwriting;\nthis, of course, isn't necessary in the case of the agreement.\"\n\nI quickly copied the few lines in which I designated myself a\nsuicide, and handed them to Wanda. She read them, and put them on the\ntable with a smile.\n\n\"Now have you the courage to sign it?\" she asked with a crafty\nsmile, inclining her head.\n\nI took the pen.\n\n\"Let me sign first,\" said Wanda, \"your hand is trembling, are you\nafraid of the happiness that is to be yours?\"\n\nShe took the agreement and pen. While engaging in my internal struggle,\nI looked upward for a moment. It occurred to me that the painting on the\nceiling, like many of those of the Italian and Dutch schools, was\nutterly unhistorical, but this very fact gave it a strange mood which\nhad an almost uncanny effect on me. Delilah, an opulent woman with\nflaming red hair, lay extended, half-disrobed, in a dark fur-cloak, upon\na red ottoman, and bent smiling over Samson who had been overthrown and\nbound by the Philistines. Her smile in its mocking coquetry was full of\na diabolical cruelty; her eyes, half-closed, met Samson's, and his with\na last look of insane passion cling to hers, for already one of his\nenemies is kneeling on his breast with the red-hot iron to blind him.\n\n\"Now--\" said Wanda. \"Why you are all lost in thought. What is the\nmatter with you, everything will remain just as it was, even after\nyou have signed, don't you know me yet, dear heart?\"\n\nI looked at the agreement. Her name was written there in bold\nletters. I peered once more into her eyes with their potent magic,\nthen I took the pen and quickly signed the agreement.\n\n\"You are trembling,\" said Wanda calmly, \"shall I help you?\"\n\nShe gently took hold of my hand, and my name appeared at the bottom\nof the second paper. Wanda looked once more at the two documents, and\nthen locked them in the desk which stood at the head of the ottoman.\n\n\"Now then, give me your passport and money.\"\n\nI took out my wallet and handed it to her. She inspected it, nodded,\nand put it with other things while in a sweet drunkenness I kneeled\nbefore her leaning my head against her breast.\n\nSuddenly she thrusts me away with her foot, leaps up, and pulls the\nbell-rope. In answer to its sound three young, slender negresses\nenter; they are as if carved of ebony, and are dressed from head to\nfoot in red satin; each one has a rope in her hand.\n\nSuddenly I realize my position, and am about to rise. Wanda stands\nproudly erect, her cold beautiful face with its sombre brows and\ncontemptous eyes is turned toward me. She stands before me as\nmistress, commanding, gives a sign with her hand, and before I really\nknow what has happened to me the negresses have dragged me to the\nground, and have tied me hand and foot. As in the case of one about\nto be executed my arms are bound behind my back, so that I can\nscarcely move.\n\n\"Give me the whip, Haydee,\" commands Wanda, with unearthly calm.\n\nThe negress hands it to her mistress, kneeling.\n\n\"And now take off my heavy furs,\" she continues, \"they impede me.\"\n\nThe negress obeyed.\n\n\"The jacket there!\" Wanda commanded.\n\nHaydee quickly brought her the _kazabaika_, set with ermine, which lay\non the bed, and Wanda slipped into it with two inimitably graceful\nmovements.\n\n\"Now tie him to the pillar here!\"\n\nThe negresses lifted me up, and twisting a heavy rope around my\nbody, tied me standing against one of the massive pillars which\nsupported the top of the wide Italian bed.\n\nThen they suddenly disappeared, as if the earth had swallowed them.\n\nWanda swiftly approached me. Her white satin dress flowed behind her\nin a long train, like silver, like moonlight; her hair flared like\nflames against the white fur of her jacket. Now she stood in front\nof me with her left hand firmly planted on her hips, in her right hand\nshe held the whip. She uttered an abrupt laugh.\n\n\"Now play has come to an end between us,\" she said with heartless\ncoldness. \"Now we will begin in dead earnest. You fool, I laugh at you\nand despise you; you who in your insane infatuation have given\nyourself as a plaything to _me_, the frivolous and capricious woman.\nYou are no longer the man I love, but _my slave_, at my mercy even\nunto life and death.\n\n\"You shall know me!\n\n\"First of all you shall have a taste of the whip in all seriousness,\nwithout having done anything to deserve it, so that you may\nunderstand what to expect, if you are awkward, disobedient, or\nrefractory.\"\n\nWith a wild grace she rolled back her fur-lined sleeve, and struck\nme across the back.\n\nI winced, for the whip cut like a knife into my flesh.\n\n\"Well, how do you like that?\" she exclaimed.\n\nI was silent.\n\n\"Just wait, you will yet whine like a dog beneath my whip,\" she\nthreatened, and simultaneously began to strike me again.\n\nThe blows fell quickly, in rapid succession, with terrific force\nupon my back, arms, and neck; I had to grit my teeth not to scream\naloud. Now she struck me in the face, warm blood ran down, but she\nlaughed, and continued her blows.\n\n\"It is only now I understand you,\" she exclaimed. \"It really is a\njoy to have some one so completely in one's power, and a man at that,\nwho loves you--you do love me?--No--Oh! I'll tear you to shreds yet,\nand with each blow my pleasure will grow. Now, twist like a worm,\nscream, whine! You will find no mercy in me!\"\n\nFinally she seemed tired.\n\nShe tossed the whip aside, stretched out on the ottoman, and rang.\n\nThe negresses entered.\n\n\"Untie him!\"\n\nAs they loosened the rope, I fell to the floor like a lump of wood.\nThe black women grinned, showing their white teeth.\n\n\"Untie the rope around his feet.\"\n\nThey did it, but I was unable to rise.\n\n\"Come over here, Gregor.\"\n\nI approached the beautiful woman. Never did she seem more seductive\nto me than to-day in spite of all her cruelty and contempt.\n\n\"One step further,\" Wanda commanded. \"Now kneel down, and kiss my\nfoot.\"\n\nShe extended her foot beyond the hem of white satin, and I, the\nsupersensual fool, pressed my lips upon it.\n\n\"Now, you won't lay eyes on me for an entire month, Gregor,\" she\nsaid seriously. \"I want to become a stranger to you, so you will more\neasily adjust yourself to our new relationship. In the meantime you\nwill work in the garden, and await my orders. Now, off with you,\nslave!\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nA month has passed with monotonous regularity, heavy work, and a\nmelancholy hunger, hunger for her, who is inflicting all these\ntorments on me.\n\nI am under the gardener's orders; I help him lop the trees and prune\nthe hedges, transplant flowers, turn over the flower beds, sweep the\ngravel paths; I share his coarse food and his hard cot; I rise and\ngo to bed with the chickens. Now and then I hear that our mistress\nis amusing herself, surrounded by admirers. Once I heard her gay\nlaughter even down here in the garden.\n\nI seem awfully stupid to myself. Was it the result of my present\nlife, or was I so before? The month is drawing to a close--the day\nafter to-morrow. What will she do with me now, or has she forgotten\nme, and left me to trim hedges and bind bouquets till my dying day?\n\nA written order.\n\n\"The slave Gregor is herewith ordered to my personal service.\n\nWanda Dunajew.\"\n\nWith a beating heart I draw aside the damask curtain on the\nfollowing morning, and enter the bed-room of my divinity. It is still\nfilled with a pleasant half darkness.\n\n\"Is it you, Gregor?\" she asks, while I kneel before the fire-place,\nbuilding a fire. I tremble at the sound of the beloved voice. I\ncannot see her herself; she is invisible behind the curtains of the\nfour-poster bed.\n\n\"Yes, my mistress,\" I reply.\n\n\"How late is it?\"\n\n\"Past nine o'clock.\"\n\n\"Breakfast.\"\n\nI hasten to get it, and then kneel down with the tray beside her bed.\n\n\"Here is breakfast, my mistress.\"\n\nWanda draws back the curtains, and curiously enough at the first\nglance when I see her among the pillows with loosened flowing hair,\nshe seems an absolute stranger, a beautiful woman, but the beloved\nsoft lines are gone. This face is hard and has an expression of\nweariness and satiety.\n\nOr is it simply that formerly my eye did not see this?\n\nShe fixes her green eyes upon me, more with curiosity than with\nmenace, perhaps even somewhat pityingly, and lazily pulls the dark\nsleeping fur on which she lies over the bared shoulder.\n\nAt this moment she is very charming, very maddening, and I feel my\nblood rising to my head and heart. The tray in my hands begins to\nsway. She notices it and reached out for the whip which is lying on\nthe toilet-table.\n\n\"You are awkward, slave,\" she says furrowing her brow.\n\nI lower my looks to the ground, and hold the tray as steadily as\npossible. She eats her breakfast, yawns, and stretches her opulent\nlimbs in the magnificent furs.\n\nShe has rung. I enter.\n\n\"Take this letter to Prince Corsini.\"\n\nI hurry into the city, and hand the letter to the Prince. He is a\nhandsome young man with glowing black eyes. Consumed with jealousy,\nI take his answer to her.\n\n\"What is the matter with you?\" she asks with lurking spitefulness.\n\"You are very pale.\"\n\n\"Nothing, mistress, I merely walked rather fast.\"\n\nAt luncheon the prince is at her side, and I am condemned to serve\nboth her and him. They joke, and I am, as if non-existent, for both.\nFor a brief moment I see black; I was just pouring some Bordeaux into\nhis glass, and spilled it over the table-cloth and her gown.\n\n\"How awkward,\" Wanda exclaimed and slapped my face. The prince\nlaughed, and she also, but I felt the blood rising to my face.\n\nAfter luncheon she drove in the Cascine. She has a little carriage\nwith a handsome, brown English horse, and holds the reins herself.\nI sit behind and notice how coquettishly she acts, and nods with a\nsmile when one of the distinguished gentlemen bows to her.\n\nAs I help her out of the carriage, she leans lightly on my arm; the\ncontact runs through me like an electric shock. She _is_ a wonderful\nwoman, and I love her more than ever.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFor dinner at six she has invited a small group of men and women. I\nserve, but this time I do not spill any wine over the table-cloth.\n\nA slap in the face is more effective than ten lectures. It makes you\nunderstand very quickly, especially when the instruction is by the\nway of a small woman's hand.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter dinner she drives to the Pergola Theater. As she descends the\nstairs in her black velvet dress with its large collar of ermine and\nwith a diadem of white roses on her hair, she is literally stunning.\nI open the carriage-door, and help her in. In front of the theater\nI leap from the driver's seat, and in alighting she leaned on my arm,\nwhich trembled under the sweet burden. I open the door of her box,\nand then wait in the vestibule. The performance lasts four hours; she\nreceives visits from her cavaliers, the while I grit my teeth with\nrage.\n\nIt is way beyond midnight when my mistress's bell sounds for the\nlast time.\n\n\"Fire!\" she orders abruptly, and when the fire-place crackles, \"Tea!\"\n\nWhen I return with the samovar, she has already undressed, and with\nthe aid of the negress slipped into a white negligee.\n\nHaydee thereupon leaves.\n\n\"Hand me the sleeping-furs,\" says Wanda, sleepily stretching her\nlovely limbs. I take them from the arm-chair, and hold them while she\nslowly and lazily slides into the sleeves. She then throws herself\ndown on the cushions of the ottoman.\n\n\"Take off my shoes, and put on my velvet slippers.\"\n\nI kneel down and tug at the little shoe which resists my efforts.\n\"Hurry, hurry!\" Wanda exclaims, \"you are hurting me! just you wait--I\nwill teach you.\" She strikes me with the whip, but now the shoe is\noff.\n\n\"Now get out!\" Still a kick--and then I can go to bed.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nTo-night I accompanied her to a soiree. In the entrance-hall she\nordered me to help her out of her furs; then with a proud smile,\nconfident of victory, she entered the brilliantly illuminated room.\nI again waited with gloomy and monotonous thoughts, watching hour after\nhour run by. From time to time the sounds of music reached me, when\nthe door remained open for a moment. Several servants tried to start\na conversation with me, but soon desisted, since I knew only a few\nwords of Italian.\n\nFinally I fell asleep, and dreamed that I murdered Wanda in a\nviolent attack of jealousy. I was condemned to death, and saw myself\nstrapped on the board; the knife fell, I felt it on my neck, but I\nwas still alive--\n\nThen the executioner slapped my face.\n\nNo, it wasn't the executioner; it was Wanda who stood wrathfully\nbefore me demanding her furs. I am at her side in a moment, and help\nher on with it.\n\nThere is a deep joy in wrapping a beautiful woman into her furs, and\nin seeing and feeling how her neck and magnificent limbs nestle in\nthe precious soft furs, and to lift the flowing hair over the collar.\nWhen she throws it off a soft warmth and a faint fragrance of her\nbody still clings to the ends of the hairs of sable. It is enough to\ndrive one mad.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFinally a day came when there were neither guests, nor theater, nor\nother company. I breathed a sigh of relief. Wanda sat in the gallery,\nreading, and apparently had no orders for me. At dusk when the\nsilvery evening mists fell she withdrew. I served her at dinner, she\nate by herself, but had not a look, not a syllable for me, not even\na slap in the face.\n\nI actually desire a slap from her hand. Tears fill my eyes, and I\nfeel that she has humiliated me so deeply, that she doesn't even find\nit worth while to torture or maltreat me any further.\n\nBefore she goes to bed, her bell calls me.\n\n\"You will sleep here to-night, I had horrible dreams last night, and\nam afraid of being alone. Take one of the cushions from the ottoman,\nand lie down on the bearskin at my feet.\"\n\nThen Wanda put out the lights. The only illumination in the room was\nfrom a small lamp suspended from the ceiling. She herself got into\nbed. \"Don't stir, so as not to wake me.\"\n\nI did as she had commanded, but could not fall asleep for a long\ntime. I saw the beautiful woman, beautiful as a goddess, lying on her\nback on the dark sleeping-furs; her arms beneath her neck, with a\nflood of red hair over them. I heard her magnificent breast rise in\ndeep regular breathing, and whenever she moved ever so slightly. I\nwoke up and listened to see whether she needed me.\n\nBut she did not require me.\n\nNo task was required of me; I meant no more to her than a night-lamp, or\na revolver which one places under one's pillow.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAm I mad or is she? Does all this arise out of an inventive, wanton\nwoman's brain with the intention of surpassing my supersensual\nfantasies, or is this woman really one of those Neronian characters\nwho take a diabolical pleasure in treading underfoot, like a worm,\nhuman beings, who have thoughts and feelings and a will like theirs?\n\nWhat have I experienced?\n\nWhen I knelt with the coffee-tray beside her bed, Wanda suddenly\nplaced her hand on my shoulder and her eyes plunged deep into mine.\n\n\"What beautiful eyes you have,\" she said softly, \"and especially now\nsince you suffer. Are you very unhappy?\"\n\nI bowed my head, and kept silent.\n\n\"Severin, do you still love me,\" she suddenly exclaimed\npassionately, \"can you still love me?\"\n\nShe drew me close with such vehemence that the coffee-tray upset,\nthe can and cups fell to the floor, and the coffee ran over the\ncarpet.\n\n\"Wanda--my Wanda,\" I cried out and held her passionately against me;\nI covered her mouth, face, and breast with kisses.\n\n\"It is my unhappiness that I love you more and more madly the worse\nyou treat me, the more frequently you betray me. Oh, I shall die of\npain and love and jealousy.\"\n\n\"But I haven't betrayed you, as yet, Severin,\" replied Wanda smiling.\n\n\"Not? Wanda! Don't jest so mercilessly with me,\" I cried. \"Haven't\nI myself taken the letter to the Prince--\"\n\n\"Of course, it was an invitation for luncheon.\"\n\n\"You have, since we have been in Florence--\"\n\n\"I have been absolutely faithful to you,\" replied Wanda, \"I swear it\nby all that is holy to me. All that I have done was merely to fulfill\nyour dream and it was done for your sake.\n\n\"However, I shall take a lover, otherwise things will be only half\naccomplished, and in the end you will yet reproach me with not having\ntreated you cruelly enough, my dear beautiful slave! But to-day you\nshall be Severin again, the only one I love. I haven't given away\nyour clothes. They are here in the chest. Go and dress as you used\nto in the little Carpathian health-resort when our love was so intimate.\nForget everything that has happened since; oh, you will forget it\neasily in my arms; I shall kiss away all your sorrows.\"\n\nShe began to treat me tenderly like a child, to kiss me and caress\nme. Finally she said with a gracious smile, \"Go now and dress, I too\nwill dress. Shall I put on my fur-jacket? Oh yes, I know, now run\nalong!\"\n\nWhen I returned she was standing in the center of the room in her\nwhite satin dress, and the red _kazabaika_ edged with ermine; her hair\nwas white with powder and over her forehead she wore a small diamond\ndiadem. For a moment she reminded me in an uncanny way of Catherine\nthe Second, but she did not give me much time for reminiscences. She\ndrew me down on the ottoman beside her and we enjoyed two blissful\nhours. She was no longer the stern capricious mistress, she was\nentirely a fine lady, a tender sweetheart. She showed me photographs\nand books which had just appeared, and talked about them with so much\nintelligence, clarity, and good taste, that I more than once carried\nher hand to my lips, enraptured. She then had me recite several of\nLermontov's poems, and when I was all afire with enthusiasm, she\nplaced her small hand gently on mine. Her expression was soft, and her\neyes were filled with tender pleasure.\n\n\"Are you happy?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\nShe then leaned back on the cushions, and slowly opened her\n_kazabaika_.\n\nBut I quickly covered the half-bared breast again with the ermine.\n\"You are driving me mad.\" I stammered.\n\n\"Come!\"\n\nI was already lying in her arms, and like a serpent she was kissing\nme with her tongue, when again she whispered, \"Are you happy?\"\n\n\"Infinitely!\" I exclaimed.\n\nShe laughed aloud. It was an evil, shrill laugh which made cold\nshivers run down by back.\n\n\"You used to dream of being the slave, the plaything of a beautiful\nwoman, and now you imagine you are a free human being, a man, my\nlover-you fool! A sign from me, and you are a slave again. Down on\nyour knees!\"\n\nI sank down from the ottoman to her feet, but my eye still clung\ndoubtingly on hers.\n\n\"You can't believe it,\" she said, looking at me with her arms folded\nacross her breast. \"I am bored, and you will just do to while away\na couple of hours of time. Don't look at me that way--\"\n\nShe kicked me with her foot.\n\n\"You are just what I want, a human being, a thing, an animal--\"\n\nShe rang. The three negresses entered.\n\n\"Tie his hands behind his back.\"\n\nI remained kneeling and unresistingly let them do this. They led me\ninto the garden, down to the little vineyard, which forms the\nsouthern boundary. Corn had been planted between the espaliers, and\nhere and there a few dead stalks still stood. To one side was a\nplough.\n\nThe negresses tied me to a post, and amused themselves sticking me\nwith their golden hair-needles. But this did not last long, before\nWanda appeared with her ermine cap on her head, and with her hands\nin the pockets of her jacket. She had me untied, and then my hands\nwere fastened together on my back. She finally had a yoke put around\nmy neck, and harnessed me to the plough.\n\nThen her black demons drove me out into the field. One of them held\nthe plough, the other one led me by a line, the third applied the\nwhip, and Venus in Furs stood to one side and looked on.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I was serving dinner on the following day Wanda said: \"Bring\nanother cover, I want you to dine with me to-day,\" and when I was\nabout to sit down opposite her, she added, \"No, over here, close by\nmy side.\"\n\nShe is in the best of humors, gives me soup with her spoon, feeds me\nwith her fork, and places her head on the table like a playful kitten\nand flirts with me. I have the misfortune of looking at Haydee, who\nserves in my place, perhaps a little longer than is necessary. It is\nonly now that I noticed her noble, almost European cast of\ncountenance and her magnificent statuesque bust, which is as if hewn\nout of black marble. The black devil observes that she pleases me,\nand, grinning, shows her teeth. She has hardly left the room, before\nWanda leaps up in a rage.\n\n\"What, you dare to look at another woman besides me! Perhaps you\nlike her even better than you do me, she is even more demonic!\"\n\nI am frightened; I have never seen her like this before; she is\nsuddenly pale even to the lips and her whole body trembles. Venus in\nFurs is jealous of her slave. She snatches the whip from its hook and\nstrikes me in the face; then she calls her black servants, who bind\nme, and carry me down into the cellar, where they throw me into a\ndark, dank, subterranean compartment, a veritable prison-cell.\n\nThen the lock of the door clicks, the bolts are drawn, a key sings\nin the lock. I am a prisoner, buried.\n\nI have been lying here for I don't know how long, bound like a calf\nabout to be hauled to the slaughter, on a bundle of damp straw,\nwithout any light, without food, without drink, without sleep. It\nwould be like her to let me starve to death, if I don't freeze to\ndeath before then. I am shaking with cold. Or is it fever? I believe\nI am beginning to hate this woman.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nA red streak, like blood, floods across the floor; it is a light\nfalling through the door which is now thrust open.\n\nWanda appears on the threshold, wrapped in her sables, holding a\nlighted torch.\n\n\"Are you still alive?\" she asks.\n\n\"Are you coming to kill me?\" I reply with a low, hoarse voice.\n\nWith two rapid strides Wanda reaches my side, she kneels down beside\nme, and places my head in her lap. \"Are you ill? Your eyes glow so,\ndo you love me? I want you to love me.\"\n\nShe draws forth a short dagger. I start with fright when its blade\ngleams in front of my eyes. I actually believe that she is about to\nkill me. She laughs, and cuts the ropes that bind me.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nEvery evening after dinner she now has me called. I have to read to\nher, and she discusses with me all sorts of interesting problems and\nsubjects. She seems entirely transformed; it is as if she were\nashamed of the savagery which she betrayed to me and of the cruelty\nwith which she treated me. A touching gentleness transfigures her\nentire being, and when at the good-night she gives me her hand, a\nsuperhuman power of goodness and love lies in her eyes, of the kind\nwhich calls forth tears in us and causes us to forget all the\nmiseries of existence and all the terrors of death.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI am reading _Manon l'Escault_ to her. She feels the association, she\ndoesn't say a word, but she smiles from time to time, and finally she\nshuts up the little book.\n\n\"Don't you want to go on reading?\"\n\n\"Not to-day. We will ourselves act _Manon l'Escault_ to-day. I have a\nrendezvous in the Cascine, and you, my dear Chevalier, will accompany\nme; I know, you will do it, won't you?\"\n\n\"You command it.\"\n\n\"I do not command it, I beg it of you,\" she says with irresistible\ncharm. She then rises, puts her hands on my shoulders, and looks at\nme.\n\n\"Your eyes!\" she exclaims. \"I love you, Severin, you have no idea\nhow I love you!\"\n\n\"Yes, I have!\" I replied bitterly, \"so much so that you have\narranged for a rendezvous with some one else.\"\n\n\"I do this only to allure you the more,\" she replied vivaciously. \"I\nmust have admirers, so as not to lose you. I don't ever want to lose\nyou, never, do you hear, for I love only you, you alone.\"\n\nShe clung passionately to my lips.\n\n\"Oh, if I only could, as I would, give you all of my soul in a kiss--\nthus--but now come.\"\n\nShe slipped into a simple black velvet coat, and put a dark _bashlyk_\n[Footnote: A kind of Russian cap.] on her head. Then she rapidly went\nthrough the gallery, and entered the carriage.\n\n\"Gregor will drive,\" she called out to the coachman who withdrew in\nsurprise.\n\nI ascended the driver's seat, and angrily whipped up the horses.\n\nIn the Cascine where the main roadway turns into a leafy path, Wanda\ngot out. It was night, only occasional stars shone through the gray\nclouds that fled across the sky. By the bank of the Arno stood a man\nin a dark cloak, with a brigand's hat, and looked at the yellow\nwaves. Wanda rapidly walked through the shrubbery, and tapped him on\nthe shoulder. I saw him turn and seize her hand, and then they\ndisappeared behind the green wall.\n\nAn hour full of torments. Finally there was a rustling in the bushes\nto one side, and they returned.\n\nThe man accompanied her to the carriage. The light of the lamp fell\nfull and glaringly upon an infinitely young, soft and dreamy face\nwhich I had never before seen, and played in his long, blond curls.\n\nShe held out her hand which he kissed with deep respect, then she\nsignaled to me, and immediately the carriage flew along the leafy\nwall which follows the river like a long green screen.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe bell at the garden-gate rings. It is a familiar face. The man\nfrom the Cascine.\n\n\"Whom shall I announce?\" I ask him in French. He timidly shakes his\nhead.\n\n\"Do you, perhaps, understand some German?\" he asks shyly.\n\n\"Yes. Your name, please.\"\n\n\"Oh! I haven't any yet,\" he replies, embarrassed--\"Tell your\nmistress the German painter from the Cascine is here and would like--\nbut there she is herself.\"\n\nWanda had stepped out on the balcony, and nodded toward the stranger.\n\n\"Gregor, show the gentleman in!\" she called to me.\n\nI showed the painter the stairs.\n\n\"Thanks, I'll find her now, thanks, thanks very much.\" He ran up the\nsteps. I remained standing below, and looked with deep pity on the\npoor German.\n\nVenus in Furs has caught his soul in the red snares of hair. He will\npaint her, and go mad.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is a sunny winter's day. Something that looks like gold trembles\non the leaves of the clusters of trees down below in the green level\nof the meadow. The camelias at the foot of the gallery are glorious\nin their abundant buds. Wanda is sitting in the loggia; she is\ndrawing. The German painter stands opposite her with his hands folded\nas in adoration, and looks at her. No, he rather looks at her face,\nand is entirely absorbed in it, enraptured.\n\nBut she does not see him, neither does she see me, who with the\nspade in my hand am turning over the flower-bed, solely that I may\nsee her and feel her nearness, which produces an effect on me like\npoetry, like music.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe painter has gone. It is a hazardous thing to do, but I risk it.\nI go up to the gallery, quite close, and ask Wanda \"Do you love the\npainter, mistress?\"\n\nShe looks at me without getting angry, shakes her head, and finally\neven smiles.\n\n\"I feel sorry for him,\" she replies, \"but I do not love him. I love no\none. _I used to love you, as ardently, as passionately, as deeply as\nit was possible for me to love,_ but now I don't love even you any\nmore; my heart is a void, dead, and this makes me sad.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\" I exclaimed, deeply moved.\n\n\"Soon, you too will no longer love me,\" she continued, \"tell me when\nyou have reached that point, and I will give back to you your\nfreedom.\"\n\n\"Then I shall remain your slave, all my life long, for I adore you\nand shall always adore you,\" I cried, seized by that fanaticism of\nlove which has repeatedly been so fatal to me.\n\nWanda looked at me with a curious pleasure. \"Consider well what you\ndo,\" she said. \"I have loved you infinitely and have been despotic\ntowards you so that I might fulfil your dream. Something of my old\nfeeling, a sort of real sympathy for you, still trembles in my\nbreast. When that too has gone who knows whether then I shall give\nyou your liberty; whether I shall not then become really cruel,\nmerciless, even brutal toward; whether I shall not take a diabolical\npleasure in tormenting and putting on the rack the man who worships\nme idolatrously, the while I remain indifferent or love someone else;\nperhaps, I shall enjoy seeing him die of his love for me. Consider\nthis well.\"\n\n\"I have long since considered all that,\" I replied as in a glow of\nfever. \"I cannot exist, cannot live without you; I shall die if you\nset me at liberty; let me remain your slave, kill me, but do not\ndrive me away.\"\n\n\"Very well then, be my slave,\" she replied, \"but don't forget that\nI no longer love you, and your love doesn't mean any more to me than\na dog's, and dogs are kicked.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nTo-day I visited the Venus of Medici.\n\nIt was still early, and the little octagonal room in the Tribuna was\nfilled with half-lights like a sanctuary; I stood with folded hands\nin deep adoration before the silent image of the divinity.\n\nBut I did not stand for long.\n\nNot a human soul was in the gallery, not even an Englishman, and I\nfell down on my knees. I looked up at the lovely slender body, the\nbudding breasts, the virginal and yet voluptuous face, the fragrant\ncurls which seemed to conceal tiny horns on each side of the forehead.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nMy mistress's bell.\n\nIt is noonday. She, however, is still abed with her arms intertwined\nbehind her neck.\n\n\"I want to bathe,\" she says, \"and you will attend me. Lock the door!\"\n\nI obey.\n\n\"Now go downstairs and make sure the door below is also locked.\"\n\nI descended the winding stairs that lead from her bedroom to the\nbath; my feet gave way beneath me, and I had to support myself\nagainst the iron banister. After having ascertained that the door\nleading to the Loggia and the garden was locked, I returned. Wanda\nwas now sitting on the bed with loosened hair, wrapped in her green\nvelvet furs. When she made a rapid movement, I noticed that the furs\nwere her only covering. It made me start terribly, I don't know why?\nI was like one condemned to death, who knows he is on the way to the\nscaffold, and yet begins to tremble when he sees it.\n\n\"Come, Gregor, take me on your arms.\"\n\n\"You mean, mistress?\"\n\n\"You are to carry me, don't you understand?\"\n\nI lifted her up, so that she rested in my arms, while she twined\nhers around my neck. Slowly, step by step, I went down the stairs\nwith her and her hair beat from time to time against my cheek and her\nfoot sought support against my knee. I trembled under the beautiful\nburden I was carrying, and every moment it seemed as if I had to\nbreak down beneath it.\n\nThe bath consisted of a wide, high rotunda, which received a soft\nquiet light from a red glass cupola above. Two palms extended their\nbroad leaves like a roof over a couch of velvet cushions. From here\nsteps covered with Turkish rugs led to the white marble basin which\noccupied the center.\n\n\"There is a green ribbon on my toilet-table upstairs,\" said Wanda,\nas I let her down on the couch, \"go get it, and also bring the whip.\"\n\nI flew upstairs and back again, and kneeling put both in my mistress's\nhands. She then had me twist her heavy electric hair into a large knot\nwhich I fastened with the green ribbon. Then I prepared the bath. I did\nthis very awkwardly because my hands and feet refused to obey me. Again\nand again I had to look at the beautiful woman lying on the red velvet\ncushions, and from time to time her wonderful body gleamed here and\nthere beneath the furs. Some magnetic power stronger than my will\ncompelled me to look. I felt that all sensuality and lustfulness lies in\nthat which is half-concealed or intentionally disclosed; and the truth\nof this I recognized even more acutely, when the basin at last was full,\nand Wanda threw off the fur-cloak with a single gesture, and stood\nbefore me like the goddess in the Tribuna.\n\nAt that moment she seemed as sacred and chaste to me in her unveiled\nbeauty, as did the divinity of long ago. I sank down on my knees\nbefore her, and devoutly pressed my lips on her foot.\n\nMy soul which had been storm-tossed only a little while earlier,\nsuddenly was perfectly calm, and I now felt no element of cruelty in\nWanda.\n\nShe slowly descended the stairs, and I could watch her with a\ncalmness in which not a single atom of torment or desire was\nintermingled. I could see her plunge into and rise out of the\ncrystalline water, and the wavelets which she herself raised played\nabout her like tender lovers.\n\nOur nihilistic aesthetician is right when he says: a real apple is\nmore beautiful than a painted one, and a living woman is more\nbeautiful than a Venus of stone.\n\nAnd when she left the bath, and the silvery drops and the roseate\nlight rippled down her body, I was seized with silent rapture. I\nwrapped the linen sheets about her, drying her glorious body. The\ncalm bliss remained with me, even now when one foot upon me as upon\na footstool, she rested on the cushions in her large velvet cloak.\nThe lithe sables nestled desirously against her cold marble-like body.\nHer left arm on which she supported herself lay like a sleeping swan\nin the dark fur of the sleeve, while her left hand played carelessly\nwith the whip.\n\nBy chance my look fell on the massive mirror on the wall opposite,\nand I cried out, for I saw the two of us in its golden frame as in\na picture. The picture was so marvellously beautiful, so strange, so\nimaginative, that I was filled with deep sorrow at the thought that\nits lines and colors would have to dissolve like mist.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Wanda.\n\nI pointed to the mirror.\n\n\"Ah, that is really beautiful,\" she exclaimed, \"too bad one can't\ncapture the moment and make it permanent.\"\n\n\"And why not?\" I asked. \"Would not any artist, even the most famous,\nbe proud if you gave him leave to paint you and make you immortal by\nmeans of his brush.\n\n\"The very thought that this extra-ordinary beauty is to be lost to\nthe world,\" I continued still watching her enthusiastically, \"is\nhorrible--all this glorious facial expression, this mysterious eye\nwith its green fires, this demonic hair, this magnificence of body.\nThe idea fills me with a horror of death, of annihilation. But the\nhand of an artist shall snatch you from this. You shall not like the\nrest of us disappear absolutely and forever, without leaving a trace\nof your having been. Your picture must live, even when you yourself\nhave long fallen to dust; your beauty must triumph beyond death!\"\n\nWanda smiled.\n\n\"Too bad, that present-day Italy hasn't a Titian or Raphael,\" she\nsaid, \"but, perhaps, love will make amends for genius, who knows; our\nlittle German might do?\" She pondered.\n\n\"Yes, he shall paint you, and I will see to it that the god of love\nmixes his colors.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe young painter has established his studio in her villa; he is\ncompletely in her net. He has just begun a Madonna, a Madonna with\nred hair and green eyes! Only the idealism of a German would attempt\nto use this thorough-bred woman as a model for a picture of\nvirginity. The poor fellow really is an almost bigger donkey than I\nam. Our misfortune is that our Titania has discovered our ass's ears\ntoo soon.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nNow she laughs derisively at us, and how she laughs! I hear her\ninsolent melodious laughter in his studio, under the open window of\nwhich I stand, jealously listening.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Are you mad, me--ah, it is unbelievable, me as the Mother of God!\"\nshe exclaimed and laughed again. \"Wait a moment, I will show you\nanother picture of myself, one that I myself have painted, and you\nshall copy it.\"\n\nHer head appeared in the window, luminous like a flame under the\nsunlight.\n\n\"Gregor!\"\n\nI hurried up the stairs, through the gallery, into the studio.\n\n\"Lead him to the bath,\" Wanda commanded, while she herself hurried\naway.\n\nA few moments passed and Wanda arrived; dressed in nothing but the\nsable fur, with the whip in her hand; she descended the stairs and\nstretched out on the velvet cushions as on the former occasion. I lay\nat her feet and she placed one of her feet upon me; her right hand\nplayed with the whip. \"Look at me,\" she said, \"with your deep,\nfanatical look, that's it.\"\n\nThe painter had turned terribly pale. He devoured the scene with his\nbeautiful dreamy blue eyes; his lips opened, but he remained dumb.\n\n\"Well, how do you like the picture?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is how I want to paint you,\" said the German, but it was\nreally not a spoken language; it was the eloquent moaning, the\nweeping of a sick soul, a soul sick unto death.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe charcoal outline of the painting is done; the heads and flesh\nparts are painted in. Her diabolical face is already becoming visible\nunder a few bold strokes, life flashes in her green eyes.\n\nWanda stands in front of the canvas with her arms crossed over her\nbreast.\n\n\"This picture, like many of those of the Venetian school, is\nsimultaneously to represent a portrait and to tell a story,\"\nexplained the painter, who again had become pale as death.\n\n\"And what will you call it?\" she asked, \"but what is the matter with\nyou, are you ill?\"\n\n\"I am afraid--\" he answered with a consuming look fixed on the\nbeautiful woman in furs, \"but let us talk of the picture.\"\n\n\"Yes, let us talk about the picture.\"\n\n\"I imagine the goddess of love as having descended from Mount Olympus\nfor the sake of some mortal man. And always cold in this modern world\nof ours, she seeks to keep her sublime body warm in a large heavy fur\nand her feet in the lap of her lover. I imagine the favorite of a\nbeautiful despot, who whips her slave, when she is tired of kissing\nhim, and the more she treads him underfoot, the more insanely he loves\nher. And so I shall call the picture: _Venus in Furs_.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe painter paints slowly, but his passion grows more and more\nrapidly. I am afraid he will end up by committing suicide. She plays\nwith him and propounds riddles to him which he cannot solve, and he\nfeels his blood congealing in the process, but it amuses her.\n\nDuring the sitting she nibbles at candies, and rolls the paper-wrappers\ninto little pellets with which she bombards him.\n\n\"I am glad you are in such good humor,\" said the painter, \"but your face\nhas lost the expression which I need for my picture.\"\n\n\"The expression which you need for your picture,\" she replied,\nsmiling. \"Wait a moment.\"\n\nShe rose, and dealt me a blow with the whip. The painter looked at\nher with stupefaction, and a child-like surprise showed on his face,\nmingled with disgust and admiration.\n\nWhile whipping me, Wanda's face acquired more and more of the cruel,\ncontemptuous character, which so haunts and intoxicates me.\n\n\"Is this the expression you need for your picture?\" she exclaimed.\nThe painter lowered his look in confusion before the cold ray of her\neye.\n\n\"It is the expression--\" he stammered, \"but I can't paint now--\"\n\n\"What?\" said Wanda, scornfully, \"perhaps I can help you?\"\n\n\"Yes--\" cried the German, as if taken with madness, \"whip me too.\"\n\n\"Oh! With pleasure,\" she replied, shrugging her shoulders, \"but if\nI am to whip you I want to do it in sober earnest.\"\n\n\"Whip me to death,\" cried the painter.\n\n\"Will you let me tie you?\" she asked, smiling.\n\n\"Yes--\" he moaned--\n\nWanda left the room for a moment, and returned with ropes.\n\n\"Well--are you still brave enough to put yourself into the power of\nVenus in Furs, the beautiful despot, for better or worse?\" she began\nironically.\n\n\"Yes, tie me,\" the painter replied dully. Wanda tied his hands on\nhis back and drew a rope through his arms and a second one around his\nbody, and fettered him to the cross-bars of the window. Then she\nrolled back the fur, seized the whip, and stepped in front of him.\n\nThe scene had a grim attraction for me, which I cannot describe. I\nfelt my heart beat, when, with a smile, she drew back her arm for the\nfirst blow, and the whip hissed through the air. He winced slightly\nunder the blow. Then she let blow after blow rain upon him, with her\nmouth half-opened and her teeth flashing between her red lips, until\nhe finally seemed to ask for mercy with his piteous, blue eyes. It\nwas indescribable.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe is sitting for him now, alone. He is working on her head.\n\nShe has posted me in the adjoining room behind a heavy curtain,\nwhere I can't be seen, but can see everything.\n\nWhat does she intend now?\n\nIs she afraid of him? She has driven him insane enough to be sure,\nor is she hatching a new torment for me? My knees tremble.\n\nThey are talking. He has lowered his voice so that I cannot\nunderstand a word, and she replies in the same way. What is the\nmeaning of this? Is there an understanding between them?\n\nI suffer frightful torments; my heart seems about to burst.\n\nHe kneels down before her, embraces her, and presses his head\nagainst her breast, and she--in her heartlessness--laughs--and now\nI hear her saying aloud:\n\n\"Ah! You need another application of the whip.\"\n\n\"Woman! Goddess! Are you without a heart--can't you love,\" exclaimed\nthe German, \"don't you even know, what it means to love, to be\nconsumed with desire and passion, can't you even imagine what I\nsuffer? Have you no pity for me?\"\n\n\"No!\" she replied proudly and mockingly, \"but I have the whip.\"\n\nShe drew it quickly from the pocket of her fur-coat, and struck him\nin the face with the handle. He rose, and drew back a couple of paces.\n\n\"Now, are you ready to paint again?\" she asked indifferently. He did\nnot reply, but again went to the easel and took up his brush and\npalette.\n\nThe painting is marvellously successful. It is a portrait which as\nfar as the likeness goes couldn't be better, and at the same time it\nseems to have an ideal quality. The colors glow, are supernatural;\nalmost diabolical, I would call them.\n\nThe painter has put all his sufferings, his adoration, and all his\nexecration into the picture.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nNow he is painting me; we are alone together for several hours every\nday. To-day he suddenly turned to me with his vibrant voice and said:\n\n\"You love this woman?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I also love her.\" His eyes were bathed in tears. He remained silent\nfor a while, and continued painting.\n\n\"We have a mountain at home in Germany within which she dwells,\" he\nmurmured to himself. \"She is a demon.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe picture is finished. She insisted on paying him for it,\nmunificently, in the manner of queens.\n\n\"Oh, you have already paid me,\" he said, with a tormented smile,\nrefusing her offer.\n\nBefore he left, he secretly opened his portfolio, and let me look\ninside. I was startled. Her head looked at me as if out of a mirror\nand seemed actually to be alive.\n\n\"I shall take it along,\" he said, \"it is mine; she can't take it\naway from me. I have earned it with my heart's blood.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I am really rather sorry for the poor painter,\" she said to me to-day,\n\"it is absurd to be as virtuous as I am. Don't you think so too?\"\n\nI did not dare to reply to her.\n\n\"Oh, I forgot that I am talking with a slave; I need some fresh air,\nI want to be diverted, I want to forget.\n\n\"The carriage, quick!\"\n\nHer new dress is extravagant: Russian half-boots of violet-blue\nvelvet trimmed with ermine, and a skirt of the same material,\ndecorated with narrow stripes and rosettes of furs. Above it is an\nappropriate, close-fitting jacket, also richly trimmed and lined with\nermine. The headdress is a tall cap of ermine of the style of\nCatherine the Second, with a small aigrette, held in place by a\ndiamond-agraffe; her red hair falls loose down her back. She ascends\non the driver's seat, and holds the reins herself; I take my seat\nbehind. How she lashes on the horses! The carriage flies along like\nmad.\n\nApparently it is her intention to attract attention to-day, to make\nconquests, and she succeeds completely. She is the lioness of the\nCascine. People nod to her from carriages; on the footpath people\ngather in groups to discuss her. She pays no attention to anyone,\nexcept now and then acknowledging the greetings of elderly gentlemen\nwith a slight nod.\n\nSuddenly a young man on a lithe black horse dashes up at full speed.\nAs soon as he sees Wanda, he stops his horse and makes it walk. When\nhe is quite close, he stops entirely and lets her pass. And she too\nsees him--the lioness, the lion. Their eyes meet. She madly drives\npast him, but she cannot tear herself free from the magic power of\nhis look, and she turns her head after him.\n\nMy heart stops when I see the half-surprised, half-enraptured look\nwith which she devours him, but he is worthy of it.\n\nFor he is, indeed, a magnificent specimen of man, No, rather, he is\na man whose like I have never yet seen among the living. He is in the\nBelvedere, graven in marble, with the same slender, yet steely\nmusculature, with the same face and the same waving curls. What makes\nhim particularly beautiful is that he is beardless. If his hips were\nless narrow, one might take him for a woman in disguise. The curious\nexpression about the mouth, the lion's lip which slightly discloses\nthe teeth beneath, lends a flashing tinge of cruelty to the beautiful\nface--\n\nApollo flaying Marsyas.\n\nHe wears high black boots, closely fitting breeches of white\nleather, short fur coat of black cloth, of the kind worn by Italian\ncavalry officers, trimmed with astrakhan and many rich loops; on his\nblack locks is a red fez.\n\nI now understand the masculine Eros, and I marvel at Socrates for\nhaving remained virtuous in view of an Alcibiades like this.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI have never seen my lioness so excited. Her cheeks flamed when she\nleft from the carriage at her villa. She hurried upstairs, and with\nan imperious gesture ordered me to follow.\n\nWalking up and down her room with long strides, she began to talk so\nrapidly, that I was frightened.\n\n\"You are to find out who the man in the Cascine was, immediately--\n\n\"Oh, what a man! Did you see him? What do you think of him? Tell me.\"\n\n\"The man is beautiful,\" I replied dully.\n\n\"He is so beautiful,\" she paused, supporting herself on the arm of\na chair, \"that he has taken my breath away.\"\n\n\"I can understand the impression he has made on you,\" I replied, my\nimagination carrying me away in a mad whirl. \"I am quite lost in\nadmiration myself, and I can imagine--\"\n\n\"You may imagine,\" she laughed aloud, \"that this man is my lover,\nand that he will apply the lash to you, and that you will enjoy being\npunished by him.\n\n\"But now go, go.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore evening fell, I had the desired information.\n\nWanda was still fully dressed when I returned. She reclined on the\nottoman, her face buried in her hands, her hair in a wild tangle,\nlike the red mane of a lioness.\n\n\"What is his name?\" she asked, uncanny calm.\n\n\"Alexis Papadopolis.\"\n\n\"A Greek, then,\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"He is very young?\"\n\n\"Scarcely older than you. They say he was educated in Paris, and\nthat he is an atheist. He fought against the Turks in Candia, and is\nsaid to have distinguished himself there no less by his race-hatred\nand cruelty, than by his bravery.\"\n\n\"All in all, then, a man,\" she cried with sparkling eyes.\n\n\"At present he is living in Florence,\" I continued, \"he is said to\nbe tremendously rich--\"\n\n\"I didn't ask you about that,\" she interrupted quickly and sharply.\n\"The man is dangerous. Aren't you afraid of him? I am afraid of him.\nHas he a wife?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"A mistress?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What theaters does he attend?\"\n\n\"To-night he will be at the Nicolini Theater, where Virginia Marini\nand Salvini are acting; they are the greatest living artists in\nItaly, perhaps in Europe.\n\n\"See that you get a box--and be quick about it!\" she commanded.\n\n\"But, mistress--\"\n\n\"Do you want a taste of the whip?\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You can wait down in the lobby,\" she said when I had placed the\nopera-glasses and the programme on the edge of her box and adjusted\nthe footstool.\n\nI am standing there and had to lean against the wall for support so\nas not to fall down with envy and rage--no, rage isn't the right\nword; it was a mortal fear.\n\nI saw her in her box dressed in blue moire, with a huge ermine cloak\nabout her bare shoulders; he sat opposite. I saw them devour each\nother with their eyes. For both of them the stage, Goldoni's _Pamela,_\nSalvini, Marini, the public, even the entire world, were non-existant\nto-night. And I--what was I at that moment?--\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nTo-day she is attending the ball at the Greek ambassador's. Does she\nknow, that she will meet him there?\n\nAt any rate she dressed, as if she did. A heavy sea-green silk dress\nplastically encloses her divine form, leaving the bust and arms bare. In\nher hair, which is done into a single flaming knot, a white water-lily\nblossoms; from it the leaves of reeds interwoven with a few loose\nstrands fall down toward her neck. There no longer is any trace of\nagitation or trembling feverishness in her being. She is calm, so calm,\nthat I feel my blood congealing and my heart growing cold under her\nglance. Slowly, with a weary, indolent majesty, she ascends the marble\nstaircase, lets her precious wrap slide off, and listlessly enters the\nhall, where the smoke of a hundred candles has formed a silvery mist.\n\nFor a few moments my eyes follow her in a daze, then I pick up her\nfurs, which without my being aware, had slipped from my hands. They\nare still warm from her shoulders.\n\nI kiss the spot, and my eyes fill with tears.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nHe has arrived.\n\nIn his black velvet coat extravagantly trimmed with sable, he is a\nbeautiful, haughty despot who plays with the lives and souls of men.\nHe stands in the ante-room, looking around proudly, and his eyes rest\non me for an uncomfortably long time.\n\nUnder his icy glance I am again seized by a mortal fear. I have a\npresentiment that this man can enchain her, captivate her, subjugate\nher, and I feel inferior in contrast with his savage masculinity; I\nam filled with envy, with jealousy.\n\nI feel that I am a queer weakly creature of brains, merely! And what\nis most humiliating, I want to hate him, but I can't. Why is that\namong all the host of servants he has chosen me.\n\nWith an inimitably aristocratic nod of the head he calls me over to\nhim, and I--I obey his call--against my own will.\n\n\"Take my furs,\" he quickly commands.\n\nMy entire body trembles with resentment, but I obey, abjectly like\na slave.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAll night long I waited in the ante-room, raving as in a fever.\nStrange images hovered past my inner eye. I saw their meeting--their\nlong exchange of looks. I saw her float through the hall in his arms,\ndrunken, lying with half-closed lids against his breast. I saw him\nin the holy of holies of love, lying on the ottoman, not as slave,\nbut as master, and she at his feet. On my knees I served them, the\ntea-tray faltering in my hands, and I saw him reach for the whip.\nBut now the servants are talking about him.\n\nHe is a man who is like a woman; he knows that he is beautiful, and\nhe acts accordingly. He changes his clothes four or five times a day,\nlike a vain courtesan.\n\nIn Paris he appeared first in woman's dress, and the men assailed\nhim with love-letters. An Italian singer, famous equally for his art\nand his passionate intensity, even invaded his home, and lying on his\nknees before him threatened to commit suicide if he wouldn't be his.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" he replied, smiling, \"I should like to do you the\nfavor, but you will have to carry out your threat, for I am a man.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe drawing-room has already thinned out to a marked degree, but she\napparently has no thought of leaving.\n\nMorning is already peering through the blinds.\n\nAt last I hear the rustling of her heavy gown which flows along\nbehind her like green waves. She advances step by step, engaged in\nconversation with him.\n\nI hardly exist for her any longer; she doesn't even trouble to give\nme an order.\n\n\"The cloak for madame,\" he commands. He, of course, doesn't think of\nlooking after her himself.\n\nWhile I put her furs about her, he stands to one side with his arms\ncrossed. While I am on my knees putting on her fur over-shoes, she\nlightly supports herself with her hand on his shoulder. She asks:\n\n\"And what about the lioness?\"\n\n\"When the lion whom she has chosen and with whom she lives is\nattacked by another,\" the Greek went on with his narrative, \"the\nlioness quietly lies down and watches the battle. Even if her mate\nis worsted she does not go to his aid. She looks on indifferently as\nhe bleeds to death under his opponent's claws, and follows the victor,\nthe stronger--that is the female's nature.\"\n\nAt this moment my lioness looked quickly and curiously at me.\n\nIt made me shudder, though I didn't know why--and the red dawn\nimmerses me and her and him in blood.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe did not go to bed, but merely threw off her ball-dress and undid\nher hair; then she ordered me to build a fire, and she sat by the\nfire-place, and stared into the flames.\n\n\"Do you need me any longer, mistress?\" I asked, my voice failed me\nat the last word.\n\nWanda shook her head.\n\nI left the room, passed through the gallery, and sat down on one of\nthe steps, leading from there down into the garden. A gentle north\nwind brought a fresh, damp coolness from the Arno, the green hills\nextended into the distance in a rosy mist, a golden haze hovered over\nthe city, over the round cupola of the Duomo.\n\nA few stars still tremble in the pale-blue sky.\n\nI tore open my coat, and pressed my burning forehead against the\nmarble. Everything that had happened so far seemed to me a mere\nchild's play; but now things were beginning to be serious, terribly\nserious.\n\nI anticipated a catastrophe, I visualized it, I could lay hold of it\nwith my hands, but I lacked the courage to meet it. My strength was\nbroken. And if I am honest with myself, neither the pains and\nsufferings that threatened me, not the humiliations that impended,\nwere the thing that frightened me.\n\nI merely felt a fear, the fear of losing her whom I loved with a\nsort of fanatical devotion; but it was so overwhelming, so crushing\nthat I suddenly began to sob like a child.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the day she remained locked in her room, and had the negress\nattend her. When the evening star rose glowing in the blue sky, I saw\nher pass through the garden, and, carefully following her at a\ndistance, watched her enter the shrine of Venus. I stealthily\nfollowed and peered through the chink in the door.\n\nShe stood before the divine image of the goddess, her hands folded\nas in prayer, and the sacred light of the star of love casts its blue\nrays over her.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nOn my couch at night the fear of losing her and despair took such\npowerful hold of me that they made a hero and a libertine of me. I\nlighted the little red oil-lamp which hung in the corridor beneath\na saint's image, and entered her bedroom, covering the light with one\nhand.\n\nThe lioness had been hunted and driven until she was exhausted. She\nhad fallen asleep among her pillows, lying on her back, her hands\nclenched, breathing heavily. A dream seemed to oppress her. I slowly\nwithdrew my hand, and let the red light fall full on her wonderful\nface.\n\nBut she did not awaken.\n\nI gently set the lamp on the floor, sank down beside Wanda's bed,\nand rested my head on her soft, glowing arm.\n\nShe moved slightly, but even now did not awaken. I do not know how\nlong I lay thus in the middle of the night, turned as into a stone\nby horrible torments.\n\nFinally a severe trembling seized me, and I was able to cry. My\ntears flowed over her arm. She quivered several times and finally sat\nup; she brushed her hand across her eyes, and looked at me.\n\n\"Severin,\" she exclaimed, more frightened than angry.\n\nI was unable to reply.\n\n\"Severin,\" she continued softly, \"what is the matter? Are you ill?\"\n\nHer voice sounded so sympathetic, so kind, so full of love, that it\nclutched my breast like red-hot tongs and I began to sob aloud.\n\n\"Severin,\" she began anew. \"My poor unhappy friend.\" Her hand gently\nstroked my hair. \"I am sorry, very sorry for you; but I can't help\nyou; with the best intention in the world I know of nothing that\nwould cure you.\"\n\n\"Oh, Wanda, must it be?\" I moaned in my agony.\n\n\"What, Severin? What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"Don't you love me any more?\" I continued. \"Haven't you even a\nlittle bit of pity for me? Has the beautiful stranger taken complete\npossession of you?\"\n\n\"I cannot lie,\" she replied softly after a short pause. \"He has made\nan impression on me which I haven't yet been able to analyse, further\nthan that I suffer and tremble beneath it. It is an impression of the\nsort I have met with in the works of poets or on the stage, but I\nalways thought it was a figment of the imagination. Oh, he is a man\nlike a lion, strong and beautiful and yet gentle, not brutal like the\nmen of our northern world. I am sorry for you, Severin, I am; but I\nmust possess him. What am I saying? I must give myself to him, if he\nwill have me.\"\n\n\"Consider your reputation, Wanda, which so far has remained\nspotless,\" I exclaimed, \"even if I no longer mean anything to you.\"\n\n\"I am considering it,\" she replied, \"I intend to be strong, as long\nas it is possible, I want--\" she buried her head shyly in the pillows\n--\"I want to become his wife--if he will have me.\"\n\n\"Wanda,\" I cried, seized again by that mortal fear, which always\nrobs me of my breath, makes me lose possession of myself, \"you want\nto be his wife, belong to him for always. Oh! Do not drive me away!\nHe does not love you--\"\n\n\"Who says that?\" she exclaimed, flaring up.\n\n\"He does not love you,\" I went on passionately, \"but I love you, I\nadore you, I am your slave, I let you tread me underfoot, I want to\ncarry you on my arms through life.\"\n\n\"Who says that he doesn't love me?\" she interrupted vehemently.\n\n\"Oh! be mine,\" I replied, \"be mine! I cannot exist, cannot live\nwithout you. Have mercy on me, Wanda, have mercy!\"\n\nShe looked at me again, and her face had her cold heartless\nexpression, her evil smile.\n\n\"You say he doesn't love me,\" she said, scornfully. \"Very well then,\nget what consolation you can out of it.\"\n\nWith this she turned over on the other side, and contemptuously\nshowed me her back.\n\n\"Good God, are you a woman without flesh or blood, haven't you a\nheart as well as I!\" I cried, while my breast heaved convulsively.\n\n\"You know what I am,\" she replied, coldly. \"I am a woman of stone,\n_Venus in Furs_, your ideal, kneel down, and pray to me.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\" I implored, \"mercy!\"\n\nShe began to laugh. I buried my face in her pillows. Pain had\nloosened the floodgates of my tears and I let them flow.\n\nFor a long time silence reigned, then Wanda slowly raised herself.\n\n\"You bore me,\" she began.\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"I am tired, let me go to sleep.\"\n\n\"Mercy,\" I implored. \"Do not drive me away. No man, no one, will\nlove you as I do.\"\n\n\"Let me go to sleep,\"--she turned her back to me again.\n\nI leaped up, and snatched the poinard, which hung beside her bed,\nfrom its sheath, and placed its point against my breast.\n\n\"I shall kill myself here before your eyes,\" I murmured dully.\n\n\"Do what you please,\" Wanda replied with complete indifference. \"But\nlet me go to sleep.\" She yawned aloud. \"I am very sleepy.\"\n\nFor a moment I stood as if petrified. Then I began to laugh and cry\nat the same time. Finally I placed the poinard in my belt, and again\nfell on my knees before her.\n\n\"Wanda, listen to me, only for a few moments,\" I begged.\n\n\"I want to go to sleep! Don't you hear!\" she cried, leaping angrily\nout of bed and pushing me away with her foot. \"You forget that I am\nyour mistress?\" When I didn't budge, she seized the whip and struck\nme. I rose; she struck me again--this time right in the face.\n\n\"Wretch, slave!\"\n\nWith clenched fist held heavenward, I left her bedroom with a sudden\nresolve. She tossed the whip aside, and broke out into clear\nlaughter. I can imagine that my theatrical attitude must have been\nvery droll.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI have determined to set myself free from this heartless woman, who\nhas treated me so cruelly, and is now about to break faith and betray\nme, as a reward for all my slavish devotion, for everything I have\nsuffered from her. I packed my few belongings into a bundle, and then\nwrote her as follows:\n\n\"Dear Madam,--\n\nI have loved you even to madness, I have given myself to you as no man\never has given himself to a woman. You have abused my most sacred\nemotions, and played an impudent, frivolous game with me. However, as\nlong as you were merely cruel and merciless, it was still possible for\nme to love you. Now you are about to become _cheap_. I am no longer\nthe slave whom you can kick about and whip. You yourself have set me\nfree, and I am leaving a woman I can only hate and despise.\n\nSeverin Kusiemski.\"\n\nI handed these lines to the negress, and hastened away as fast as I\ncould go. I arrived at the railway-station all out of breath.\nSuddenly I felt a sharp pain in my heart and stopped. I began to\nweep. It is humiliating that I want to flee and I can't. I turn back--\nwhither?--to her, whom I abhor, and yet, at the same time, adore.\n\nAgain I pause. I cannot go back. I dare not.\n\nBut how am I to leave Florence. I remember that I haven't any money,\nnot a penny. Very well then, on foot; it is better to be an honest\nbeggar than to eat the bread of a courtesan.\n\nBut still I can't leave.\n\nShe has my pledge, my word of honor. I have to return. Perhaps she\nwill release me.\n\nAfter a few rapid strides, I stop again.\n\nShe has my word of honor and my bond, that I shall remain her slave\nas long as she desires, until she herself gives me my freedom. But\nI might kill myself.\n\nI go through the Cascine down to the Arno, where its yellow waters\nplash monotonously about a couple of stray willows. There I sit, and\ncast up my final accounts with existence. I let my entire life pass\nbefore me in review. On the whole, it is rather a wretched affair--a\nfew joys, an endless number of indifferent and worthless things, and\nbetween these an abundant harvest of pains, miseries, fears,\ndisappointments, shipwrecked hopes, afflictions, sorrow and grief.\n\nI thought of my mother, whom I loved so deeply and whom I had to\nwatch waste away beneath a horrible disease; of my brother, who full\nof the promise of joy and happiness died in the flower of youth,\nwithout even having put his lips to the cup of life. I thought of my\ndead nurse, my childhood playmates, the friends that had striven and\nstudied with me; of all those, covered by the cold, dead, indifferent\nearth. I thought of my turtle-dove, who not infrequently made his\ncooing bows to me, instead of to his mate.--All have returned, dust\nunto dust.\n\nI laughed aloud, and slid down into the water, but at the same\nmoment I caught hold of one of the willow-branches, hanging above the\nyellow waves. As in a vision, I see the woman who has caused all my\nmisery. She hovers above the level of the water, luminous in the\nsunlight as though she were transparent, with red flames about her\nhead and neck. She turns her face toward me and smiles.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI am back again, dripping, wet through, glowing with shame and\nfever. The negress has delivered my letter; I am judged, lost, in the\npower of a heartless, affronted woman.\n\nWell, let her kill me. I am unable to do it myself, and yet I have\nno wish to go on living.\n\nAs I walk around the house, she is standing in the gallery, leaning\nover the railing. Her face is full in the light of the sun, and her\ngreen eyes sparkle.\n\n\"Still alive?\" she asked, without moving. I stood silent, with bowed\nhead.\n\n\"Give me back my poinard,\" she continued. \"It is of no use to you.\nYou haven't even the courage to take your own life.\"\n\n\"I have lost it,\" I replied, trembling, shaken by chills.\n\nShe looked me over with a proud, scornful glance.\n\n\"I suppose you lost it in the Arno?\" She shrugged her shoulders. \"No\nmatter. Well, and why didn't you leave?\"\n\nI mumbled something which neither she nor I myself could understand.\n\n\"Oh! you haven't any money,\" she cried. \"Here!\" With an\nindescribably disdainful gesture she tossed me her purse.\n\nI did not pick it up.\n\nBoth of us were silent for some time.\n\n\"You don't want to leave then?\"\n\n\"I can't.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWanda drives in the Cascine without me, and goes to the theater\nwithout me; she receives company, and the negress serves her. No one\nasks after me. I stray about the garden, irresolutely, like an animal\nthat has lost its master.\n\nLying among the bushes, I watch a couple of sparrows, fighting over\na seed.\n\nSuddenly I hear the swish of a woman's dress.\n\nWanda approaches in a gown of dark silk, modestly closed up to the\nneck; the Greek is with her. They are in an eager discussion, but I\ncannot as yet understand a word of what they are saying. He stamps\nhis foot so that the gravel scatters about in all directions, and he\nlashes the air with his riding whip. Wanda startles.\n\nIs she afraid that he will strike her?\n\nHave they gone that far?\n\nHe has left her, she calls him; he does not hear her, does not want\nto hear her.\n\nWanda sadly lowers her head, and then sits down on the nearest\nstone-bench. She sits for a long time, lost in thought. I watch her with\na sort of malevolent pleasure, finally I pull myself together by sheer\nforce of will, and ironically step before her. She startles, and\ntrembles all over.\n\n\"I come to wish you happiness,\" I said, bowing, \"I see, my dear\nlady, too, has found a master.\"\n\n\"Yes, thank God!\" she exclaimed, \"not a new slave, I have had enough\nof them. A master! Woman needs a master, and she adores him.\"\n\n\"You adore him, Wanda?\" I cried, \"this brutal person--\"\n\n\"Yes, I love him, as I have never loved any one else.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\" I clenched my fists, but tears already filled my eyes, and\nI was seized by the delirium of passion, as by a sweet madness. \"Very\nwell, take him as your husband, let him be your master, but I want\nto remain your slave, as long as I live.\"\n\n\"You want to remain my slave, even then?\" she said, \"that would be\ninteresting, but I am afraid he wouldn't permit it.\"\n\n\"He?\"\n\n\"Yes, he is already jealous of you,\" she exclaimed, \"he, of you! He\ndemanded that I dismiss you immediately, and when I told him who you\nwere--\"\n\n\"You told him--\" I repeated, thunderstruck.\n\n\"I told him everything,\" she replied, \"our whole story, all your\nqueerness, everything--and he, instead of being amused, grew angry,\nand stamped his foot.\"\n\n\"And threatened to strike you?\"\n\nWanda looked to the ground, and remained silent.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" I said with mocking bitterness, \"you are afraid of\nhim, Wanda!\" I threw myself down at her feet, and in my agitation\nembraced her knees. \"I don't want anything of you, except to be your\nslave, to be always near you! I will be your dog-\"\n\n\"Do you know, you bore me?\" said Wanda, indifferently.\n\nI leaped up. Everything within me was seething.\n\n\"You are now no longer cruel, but cheap,\" I said, clearly and\ndistinctly, accentuating every word.\n\n\"You have already written that in your letter,\" Wanda replied, with\na proud shrug of the shoulders. \"A man of brains should never repeat\nhimself.\"\n\n\"The way you are treating me,\" I broke out, \"what would you call it?\"\n\n\"I might punish you,\" she replied ironically, \"but I prefer this\ntime to reply with reasons instead of lashes. You have no right to\naccuse me. Haven't I always been honest with you? Haven't I warned\nyou more than once? Didn't I love you with all my heart, even\npassionately, and did I conceal the fact from you, that it was\ndangerous to give yourself into my power, to abase yourself before\nme, and that I want to be dominated? But you wished to be my\nplaything, my slave! You found the highest pleasure in feeling the\nfoot, the whip of an arrogant, cruel woman. What do you want now?\n\n\"Dangerous potentialities were slumbering in me, but you were the\nfirst to awaken them. If I now take pleasure in torturing you,\nabusing you, it is your fault; you have made of me what I now am, and\nnow you are even unmanly, weak, and miserable enough to accuse me.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am guilty,\" I said, \"but haven't I suffered because of it?\nLet us put an end now to the cruel game.\"\n\n\"That is my wish, too,\" she replied with a curious deceitful look.\n\n\"Wanda!\" I exclaimed violently, \"don't drive me to extremes; you see\nthat I am a man again.\"\n\n\"A fire of straw,\" she replied, \"which makes a lot of stir for a\nmoment, and goes out as quickly as it flared up. You imagine you can\nintimidate me, and you only make yourself ridiculous. Had you been\nthe man I first thought you were, serious, reserved, stern, I would\nhave loved you faithfully, and become your wife. Woman demands that\nshe can look up to a man, but one like you who voluntarily places his\nneck under her foot, she uses as a welcome plaything, only to toss\nit aside when she is tired of it.\"\n\n\"Try to toss me aside,\" I said, jeeringly. \"Some toys are dangerous.\"\n\n\"Don't challenge me,\" exclaimed Wanda. Her eyes began to flash, and\na flush entered her cheeks.\n\n\"If you won't be mine now,\" I continued, with a voice stifled with\nrage, \"no one else shall possess you either.\"\n\n\"What play is this from?\" she mocked, seizing me by the breast. She\nwas pale with anger at this moment. \"Don't challenge me,\" she\ncontinued, \"I am not cruel, but I don't know whether I may not become\nso and whether then there will be any bounds.\"\n\n\"What worse can you do, than to make your lover, your husband?\" I\nexclaimed, more and more enraged.\n\n\"I might make you _his_ slave,\" she replied quickly, \"are you not in\nmy power? Haven't I the agreement? But, of course, you will merely\ntake pleasure in it, if I have you bound, and say to him.\n\n\"Do with him what you please.\"\n\n\"Woman, are you mad!\" I cried.\n\n\"I am entirely rational,\" she said, calmly. \"I warn you for the last\ntime. Don't offer any resistance, one who has gone as far as I have\ngone might easily go still further. I feel a sort of hatred for you,\nand would find a real joy in seeing him beat you to death; I am still\nrestraining myself, but--\"\n\nScarcely master of myself any longer, I seized her by the wrist and\nforced her to the ground, so that she lay on her knees before me.\n\n\"Severin!\" she cried. Rage and terror were painted on her face.\n\n\"I shall kill you if you marry him,\" I threatened; the words came\nhoarsely and dully from my breast. \"You are mine, I won't let you go,\nI love you too much.\" Then I clutched her and pressed her close to\nme; my right hand involuntarily seized the dagger which I still had\nin my belt.\n\nWanda fixed a large, calm, incomprehensible look on me.\n\n\"I like you that way,\" she said, carelessly. \"Now you are a man, and\nat this moment I know I still love you.\"\n\n\"Wanda,\" I wept with rapture, and bent down over her, covering her\ndear face with kisses, and she, suddenly breaking into a loud gay\nlaugh, said, \"Have you finished with your ideal now, are you\nsatisfied with me?\"\n\n\"You mean?\" I stammered, \"that you weren't serious?\"\n\n\"I am very serious,\" she gaily continued. \"I love you, only you, and\nyou--you foolish, little man, didn't know that everything was only\nmake-believe and play-acting. How hard it often was for me to strike\nyou with the whip, when I would have rather taken your head and\ncovered it with kisses. But now we are through with that, aren't we?\nI have played my cruel role better than you expected, and now you\nwill be satisfied with my being a good, little wife who isn't\naltogether unattractive. Isn't that so? We will live like rational\npeople--\"\n\n\"You will marry me!\" I cried, overflowing with happiness.\n\n\"Yes--marry you--you dear, darling man,\" whispered Wanda, kissing my\nhands.\n\nI drew her up to my breast.\n\n\"Now, you are no longer Gregor, my slave,\" said she, \"but Severin,\nthe dear man I love--\"\n\n\"And he--you don't love him?\" I asked in agitation.\n\n\"How could you imagine my loving a man of his brutal type? You were\nblind to everything, I was really afraid for you.\"\n\n\"I almost killed myself for your sake.\"\n\n\"Really?\" she cried, \"ah, I still tremble at the thought, that you\nwere already in the Arno.\"\n\n\"But you saved me,\" I replied, tenderly. \"You hovered over the\nwaters and smiled, and your smile called me back to life.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI have a curious feeling when I now hold her in my arms and she lies\nsilently against my breast and lets me kiss her and smiles. I feel\nlike one who has suddenly awakened out of a feverish delirium, or\nlike a shipwrecked man who has for many days battled with waves that\nmomentarily threatened to devour him and finally has found a safe\nshore.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I hate this Florence, where you have been so unhappy,\" she\ndeclared, as I was saying good-night to her. \"I want to leave\nimmediately, tomorrow, you will be good enough to write a couple of\nletters for me, and, while you are doing that, I will drive to the\ncity to pay my farewell visits. Is that satisfactory to you?\"\n\n\"Of course, you dear, sweet, beautiful woman.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nEarly in the morning she knocked at my door to ask how I had slept.\nHer tenderness is positively wonderful. I should never have believed\nthat she could be so tender.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe has now been gone for over four hours. I have long since\nfinished the letters, and am now sitting in the gallery, looking down\nthe street to see whether I cannot discover her carriage in the\ndistance. I am a little worried about her, and yet I know there is\nno reason under heaven why I should doubt or fear. However, a feeling\nof oppression weighs me down, and I cannot rid myself of it. It is\nprobably the sufferings of the past days, which still cast their\nshadows into my soul.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe is back, radiant with happiness and contentment.\n\n\"Well, has everything gone as you wished?\" I asked tenderly, kissing\nher hand.\n\n\"Yes, dear heart,\" she replied, \"and we shall leave to-night. Help\nme pack my trunks.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nToward evening she asked me to go to the post-office and mail her\nletters myself. I took her carriage, and was back within an hour.\n\n\"Mistress has asked for you,\" said the negress, with a grin, as I\nascended the wide marble stairs.\n\n\"Has anyone been here?\"\n\n\"No one,\" she replied, crouching down on the steps like a black cat.\n\nI slowly passed through the drawing-room, and then stood before her\nbedroom door.\n\nWhy does my heart beat so? Am I not perfectly happy?\n\nOpening the door softly, I draw back the portiere. Wanda is lying on\nthe ottoman, and does not seem to notice me. How beautiful she looks,\nin her silver-gray dress, which fits closely, and while displaying\nin tell-tale fashion her splendid figure, leaves her wonderful bust\nand arms bare.\n\nHer hair is interwoven with, and held up by a black velvet ribbon.\nA mighty fire is burning in the fire-place, the hanging lamp casts\na reddish glow, and the whole room is as if drowned in blood.\n\n\"Wanda,\" I said at last.\n\n\"Oh Severin,\" she cried out joyously. \"I have been impatiently\nwaiting for you.\" She leaped up, and folded me in her arms. She sat\ndown again on the rich cushions and tried to draw me down to her\nside, but I softly slid down to her feet and placed my head in her\nlap.\n\n\"Do you know I am very much in love with you to-day?\" she whispered,\nbrushing a few stray hairs from my forehead and kissing my eyes.\n\n\"How beautiful your eyes are, I have always loved them as the best\nof you, but to-day they fairly intoxicate me. I am all--\" She\nextended her magnificent limbs and tenderly looked at me from beneath\nher red lashes.\n\n\"And you--you are cold--you hold me like a block of wood; wait, I'll\nstir you with the fire of love,\" she said, and again clung fawningly\nand caressingly to my lips.\n\n\"I no longer please you; I suppose I'll have to be cruel to you\nagain, evidently I have been too kind to you to-day. Do you know, you\nlittle fool, what I shall do, I shall whip you for a while--\"\n\n\"But child--\"\n\n\"I want to.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"Come, let me bind you,\" she continued, and ran gaily through the\nroom. \"I want to see you very much in love, do you understand? Here\nare the ropes. I wonder if I can still do it?\"\n\nShe began with fettering my feet and then she tied my hands behind\nmy back, pinioning my arms like those of a prisoner.\n\n\"So,\" she said, with gay eagerness. \"Can you still move?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Fine--\"\n\nShe then tied a noose in a stout rope, threw it over my head, and\nlet it slip down as far as the hips. She drew it tight, and bound me\nto a pillar.\n\nA curious tremor seized me at that moment.\n\n\"I have a feeling as if I were about to be executed,\" I said with a\nlow voice.\n\n\"Well, you shall have a thorough punishment to-day,\" exclaimed Wanda.\n\n\"But put on your fur-jacket, please,\" I said.\n\n\"I shall gladly give you that pleasure,\" she replied. She got her\n_kazabaika_, and put it on. Then she stood in front of me with\nher arms folded across her chest, and looked at me out of half-closed\neyes.\n\n\"Do you remember the story of the ox of Dionysius?\" she asked.\n\n\"I remember it only vaguely, what about it?\"\n\n\"A courtier invented a new implement of torture for the Tyrant of\nSyracuse. It was an iron ox in which those condemned to death were\nto be shut, and then pushed into a mighty furnace.\n\n\"As soon as the iron ox began to get hot, and the condemned person\nbegan to cry out in his torment, his wails sounded like the bellowing\nof an ox.\n\n\"Dionysius nodded graciously to the inventor, and to put his\ninvention to an immediate test had him shut up in the iron ox.\n\n\"It is a very instructive story.\n\n\"It was you who innoculated me with selfishness, pride, and cruelty,\nand _you shall be their first victim._ I now literally enjoy having a\nhuman being that thinks and feels and desires like myself in my power;\nI love to abuse a man who is stronger in intelligence and body than I,\nespecially a man who loves me.\n\n\"Do you still love me?\"\n\n\"Even to madness,\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"So much the better,\" she replied, \"and so much the more will you\nenjoy what I am about to do with you now.\"\n\n\"What is the matter with you?\" I asked. \"I don't understand you,\nthere is a gleam of real cruelty in your eyes to-day, and you are\nstrangely beautiful--completely _Venus in Furs.\"_\n\nWithout replying Wanda placed her arms around my neck and kissed me.\nI was again seized by my fanatical passion.\n\n\"Where is the whip?\" I asked.\n\nWanda laughed, and withdrew a couple of steps.\n\n\"You really insist upon being punished?\" she exclaimed, proudly\ntossing back her head.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nSuddenly Wanda's face was completely transformed. It was as if\ndisfigured by rage; for a moment she seemed even ugly to me.\n\n\"Very well, then _you_ whip him!\" she called loudly.\n\nAt the same instant the beautiful Greek stuck his head of black\ncurls through the curtains of her four-poster bed. At first I was\nspeechless, petrified. There was a horribly comic element in the\nsituation. I would have laughed aloud, had not my position been at\nthe same time so terribly cruel and humiliating.\n\nIt went beyond anything I had imagined. A cold shudder ran down my\nback, when my rival stepped from the bed in his riding boots, his\ntight-fitting white breeches, and his short velvet jacket, and I saw\nhis athletic limbs.\n\n\"You are indeed cruel,\" he said, turning to Wanda.\n\n\"Only inordinately fond of pleasure,\" she replied with a wild sort\nof humor. \"Pleasure alone lends value to existence; whoever enjoys\ndoes not easily part from life, whoever suffers or is needy meets\ndeath like a friend.\n\n\"But whoever wants to enjoy must take life gaily in the sense of the\nancient world; he dare not hesitate to enjoy at the expense of others;\nhe must never feel pity; he must be ready to harness others to his\ncarriage or his plough as though they were animals. He must know how to\nmake slaves of men who feel and would enjoy as he does, and use them for\nhis service and pleasure without remorse. It is not his affair whether\nthey like it, or whether they go to rack and ruin. He must always\nremember this, that if they had him in their power, as he has them they\nwould act in exactly the same way, and he would have to pay for their\npleasure with his sweat and blood and soul. That was the world of the\nancients: pleasure and cruelty, liberty and slavery went hand in hand.\nPeople who want to live like the gods of Olympus must of necessity have\nslaves whom they can toss into their fish-ponds, and gladiators who will\ndo battle, the while they banquet, and they must not mind if by chance a\nbit of blood bespatters them.\"\n\nHer words brought back my complete self-possession.\n\n\"Unloosen me!\" I exclaimed angrily.\n\n\"Aren't you my slave, my property?\" replied Wanda. \"Do you want me\nto show you the agreement?\"\n\n\"Untie me!\" I threatened, \"otherwise--\" I tugged at the ropes.\n\n\"Can he tear himself free?\" she asked. \"He has threatened to kill me.\"\n\n\"Be entirely at ease,\" said the Greek, testing my fetters.\n\n\"I shall call for help,\" I began again.\n\n\"No one will hear you,\" replied Wanda, \"and no one will hinder me\nfrom abusing your most sacred emotions or playing a frivolous game\nwith you.\" she continued, repeating with satanic mockery phrases from\nmy letter to her.\n\n\"Do you think I am at this moment merely cruel and merciless, or am\nI also about to become cheap? What? Do you still love me, or do you\nalready hate and despise me? Here is the whip--\" She handed it to the\nGreek who quickly stepped closer.\n\n\"Don't you dare!\" I exclaimed, trembling with indignation, \"I won't\npermit it--\"\n\n\"Oh, because I don't wear furs,\" the Greek replied with an ironical\nsmile, and he took his short sable from the bed.\n\n\"You are adorable,\" exclaimed Wanda, kissing him, and helping him\ninto his furs.\n\n\"May I really whip him?\" he asked.\n\n\"Do with him what you please,\" replied Wanda.\n\n\"Beast!\" I exclaimed, utterly revolted.\n\nThe Greek fixed his cold tigerish look upon me and tried out the\nwhip. His muscles swelled when he drew back his arms, and made the\nwhip hiss through the air. I was bound like Marsyas while Apollo was\ngetting ready to flay me.\n\nMy look wandered about the room and remained fixed on the ceiling,\nwhere Samson, lying at Delilah's feet, was about to have his eyes put\nout by the Philistines. The picture at that moment seemed to me like\na symbol, an eternal parable of passion and lust, of the love of man\nfor woman. \"Each one of us in the end is a Samson,\" I thought, \"and\nultimately for better or worse is betrayed by the woman he loves,\nwhether he wears an ordinary coat or sables.\"\n\n\"Now watch me break him in,\" said the Greek. He showed his teeth,\nand his face acquired the blood-thirsty expression, which startled\nme the first time I saw him.\n\nAnd he began to apply the lash--so mercilessly, with such frightful\nforce that I quivered under each blow, and began to tremble all over\nwith pain. Tears rolled down over my cheeks. In the meantime Wanda\nlay on the ottoman in her fur-jacket, supporting herself on her arm;\nshe looked on with cruel curiosity, and was convulsed with laughter.\n\nThe sensation of being whipped by a successful rival before the eyes\nof an adored woman cannot be described. I almost went mad with shame\nand despair.\n\nWhat was most humiliating was that at first I felt a certain wild,\nsupersensual stimulation under Apollo's whip and the cruel laughter\nof my Venus, no matter how horrible my position was. But Apollo\nwhipped on and on, blow after blow, until I forgot all about poetry,\nand finally gritted my teeth in impotent rage, and cursed my wild\ndreams, woman, and love.\n\nAll of a sudden I saw with horrible clarity whither blind passion\nand lust have led man, ever since Holofernes and Agamemnon--into a\nblind alley, into the net of woman's treachery, into misery, slavery,\nand death.\n\nIt was as though I were awakening from a dream.\n\nBlood was already flowing under the whip. I wound like a worm that\nis trodden on, but he whipped on without mercy, and she continued to\nlaugh without mercy. In the meantime she locked her packed trunk and\nslipped into her travelling furs, and was still laughing, when she\nwent downstairs on his arm and entered the carriage.\n\nThen everything was silent for a moment.\n\nI listened breathlessly.\n\nThe carriage door slammed, the horse began to pull--the rolling of\nthe carriage for a short time--then all was over.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment I thought of taking vengeance, of killing him, but I\nwas bound by the abominable agreement. So nothing was left for me to\ndo except to keep my pledged word and grit my teeth.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nMy first impulse after this, the most cruel catastrophe of my life,\nwas to seek laborious tasks, dangers, and privations. I wanted to\nbecome a soldier and go to Asia or Algiers, but my father was old and\nill and wanted me.\n\nSo I quietly returned home and for two years helped him bear his\nburdens, and learned how to look after the estate which I had never\ndone before. To _labor_ and to _do my duty_ was comforting like a\ndrink of fresh water. Then my father died, and I inherited the estate,\nbut it meant no change.\n\nI had put on my own Spanish boots and went on living just as\nrationally as if the old man were standing behind me, looking over\nmy shoulder with his large wise eyes.\n\nOne day a box arrived, accompanied by a letter. I recognized Wanda's\nwriting.\n\nCuriously moved, I opened it, and read.\n\n\"Sir.--\n\nNow that over three years have passed since that night in Florence,\nI suppose, I may confess to you that I loved you deeply. You\nyourself, however, stifled my love by your fantastic devotion and\nyour insane passion. From the moment that you became my slave, I knew\nit would be impossible for you ever to become my husband. However,\nI found it interesting to have you realize your ideal in my own person,\nand, while I gloriously amused myself, perhaps, to cure you.\n\nI found the strong man for whom I felt a need, and I was as happy\nwith him as, I suppose, it is possible for any one to be on this\nfunny ball of clay.\n\nBut my happiness, like all things mortal, was of short duration.\nAbout a year ago he fell in a duel, and since then I have been living\nin Paris, like an Aspasia--\n\nAnd you?--Your life surely is not without its sunshine, if you have\ngained control of your imagination, and those qualities in you have\nmaterialized, which at first so attracted me to you--your clarity of\nintellect, kindness of heart, and, above all else, your--_moral\nseriousness_.\n\nI hope you have been cured under my whip; the cure was cruel, but\nradical. In memory of that time and of a woman who loved you\npassionately, I am sending you the portrait by the poor German.\n\n_Venus in Furs_.\"\n\nI had to smile, and as I fell to musing the beautiful woman suddenly\nstood before me in her velvet jacket trimmed with ermine, with the\nwhip in her hand. And I continued to smile at the woman I had once\nloved so insanely, at the fur-jacket that had once so entranced me,\nat the whip, and ended by smiling at myself and saying: The cure was\ncruel, but radical; but the main point is, I have been cured.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"And the moral of the story?\" I said to Severin when I put the\nmanuscript down on the table.\n\n\"That I was a donkey,\" he exclaimed without turning around, for he\nseemed to be embarrassed. \"If only I had beaten her!\"\n\n\"A curious remedy,\" I exclaimed, \"which might answer with your\npeasant-women--\"\n\n\"Oh, they are used to it,\" he replied eagerly, \"but imagine the\neffect upon one of our delicate, nervous, hysterical ladies--\"\n\n\"But the moral?\"\n\n\"That woman, as nature has created her and as man is at present\neducating her, is his enemy. She can only be his slave or his despot,\nbut _never his companion._ This she can become only when she has\nthe same rights as he, and is his equal in education and work.\n\n\"At present we have only the choice of being hammer or anvil, and I\nwas the kind of donkey who let a woman make a slave of him, do you\nunderstand?\n\n\"The moral of the tale is this: whoever allows himself to be\nwhipped, deserves to be whipped.\n\n\"The blows, as you see, have agreed with me; the roseate supersensual\nmist has dissolved, and no one can ever make me believe again that\nthese 'sacred apes of Benares' [Footnote: One of Schopenhauer's\ndesignations for women.] or Plato's rooster [Footnote: Diogenes\nthrew a plucked rooster into Plato's school and exclaimed: \"Here\nyou have Plato's human being.\"] are the image of God.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Venus in Furs, by Ritter von Leopold Sacher-Masoch\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK VENUS IN FURS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 6852-8.txt or 6852-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/6/8/5/6852/\n\nProduced by Avinash Kothare, Tom Allen, Tiffany Vergon,\nCharles Aldarondo, Charles Franks and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team.\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\nChief Executive and Director\ngbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks."}, {"Title": "One, Two Step (feat.

his finst homy commulion, after that same barbecue bean \u2014 feast was all over poor old hospitable corn and eggfactor, King Roderick O\u2019Conor, the paramount chief polemarch and last pre-electric king of Ireland, who was anything you say yourself be \u2014 tween fiftyodd and fiftyeven years of age at the time after the socalled last supper he greatly gave in his umbrageous house of the hundred bottles with the radio beamer tower and its hangars, chimbneys and equilines or, at least, he was\u2019nt actually the then last king of all Ireland for the time being for the jolly good reason that he was still such as he was the eminent king of all Ireland himself after the last preeminent king of all Ireland, the whilom joky old top that went before him in the Taharan dy-nasty, King Arth Mockmorrow Koughenough of the leathered leggions, now of parts unknown, (God guard his generous comicsongbook soul!) that put a poached fowl in the poor man\u2019s pot before he

sleet witht the widow Nolan\u2019s goats and the Brownes girls neats anyhow, wait till I tell you, what did he do, poor old Roderick O\u2019Conor Rex, the aus-picious waterproof monarch of all Ireland, when he found him \u2014 self all alone by himself in his grand old handwedown pile after all of them had all gone off with themselves to their castles of mud, as best they cud, on footback, owing to the leak of the McCarthy\u2019s mare, in extended order, a tree\u2019s length from the longest way out, down the switchbackward slidder of the land-sown route of Hauburnea\u2019s liveliest vinnage on the brain, the unimportant Parthalonians with the mouldy Firbolgs and the Tuatha de Danaan googs and the ramblers from Clane and all the rest of the notmuchers that he did not care the royal spit out of his ostensible mouth about, well, what do you think he did, sir, but, faix, he just went heeltapping through the winespilth and weevily popcorks that were kneedeep round his own

and the supereminent lord of them all, overwhelmed as he was with black ruin like a sponge out of water, allocutioning in bellcantos to his own oliverian society MacGuiney\u2019s Dreans of Ergen Adams

Chris Brown)", "Artist": "Kid Ink", "Lyrics": "Hi, I'm the Rap Critic, and\u2026 look, I know pop songs are typically lazily-written, blatantly sexual, and just the lowest common denominator when it comes to portraying any sort of intelligence, but this is just\u2026 okay, let's start from the beginning\n\nThis is Kid Ink. His main attribute is that he has tattoos. Like, a lot of tattoos. Other than that, he, uh\u2026 look, he's the new version of whoever had a hit song last year, but didn't stick around long. For all intents and purposes, he's j-kwon version 10 for the year 2014. And if you don't remember who J-Kwon is, well, that's exactly my point. So, here's Kid Ink's 2014 reimagining of the 4,348th song about being in the club and wanting to have sex with a girl, but\u2026 in the assembly line of mediocre pop/rap songs, something happened in the process that made this particular product defective.  and it starts with Chris Brown, who should be weaving one of those suggestive yet subtle pop song choruses that R and B singers are known for, right?\n\n\"Baby let me put your panties to the side (uh)\"\n\n\u2026.You know, that's romantic\u2026\n\nBut seriously, wow, talk about cutting to the chase. You know, most songs usually have some some sort of build up to an explicit lyric, some set up of some kind. Jeez, even Enrique Igacias at least begged her pardon first *\"Please excuse me, I don't mean to be rude\"* before saying, *\"But tonight, I'm fucking you\"* . But when you just kick off a song with \"Baby lemme put your panties to the side\" I can't help but feel like we skipped a few steps. It just seems a little contrary to the smooth R and B singer thing he's trying to pull off\n\n\"I'mma make you feel alright\n\u2018Cause I'mma give you what you need, yeah\"\n\nOkay, now we're back into the vague, obviously sexual but in no way descriptive style of songwriting that you guys are known for!\n\n\"Mami you remind me of something\nBut I don\u2019t know what it is (I don't know)\"\n\n\u2026.*amused, quick-off-and-back glance*\n\n\"You remind me of something (uh)\nBut I don\u2019t know what it is right now\"\n\n\u2026*chuckling* You've gotta be kidding me! Are you really gonna base the hook of this chorus around an unfinished pick up line?\n\n\"You remind me of something (uh)\nBut I don\u2019t know what it is right now\"\n\nDon't try to act like this is some slick turn of phrase, you sound like you just couldn't read what the songwriters gave you on the note pad!\n\n\"Mami you remind me of something\nBut I don\u2019t know what it is (I don't know)\"\n\nI don't know what\u2026 what is this trying to do?! Are you trying to pass off forgetfulness as sexy? You guys must think amnesia is downright titillating! no really, I wanna know the thought process behind this. Maybe, they realized how corny pick up line choruses were getting, especially after whole bedrock debacle, and thought they could do a Seinfeld-type one up move by comparing her to\u2026 nothing. Nah, that sounds too existential. Was this, maybe\u2026 some sort of homage to that old R. Kelly song?\n\n\"You remind me of something\nI just can't think of what it is\"\n\nBut wait, in THAT song, he immediately starts using comparisons\n\n\"You remind me of my jeep, I wanna ride it\nSomething like my sound, I wanna pump it\"\n\nSure, they're stupid comparisons, I mean, I don't think any woman wants to be compared to a jeep, if being compared to cars at all. I mean, if you were, why not something like a maserati, or a lamborghini, those are some sexy cars. In fact, I'm pretty sure there's an adult actress NAMED maserati, because that sounds cool. But, no girl would call herself a jeep. I mean look at this thing, it's bulky and asexual at best. You might as well call her a van. So, maybe they weren't referencing that song. Maybe this chorus was just completely improvised, and he just blurted out whatever came to mind first\n\n\"Hands in the air, looking' for a bitch right now\"\n\nYeah, that would explain a lot.. But wait, I didn't let the chorus continue, maybe there's something in there I forgot about. What does he say after that line?\n\n\"Cause you remind me of something (uh)\nGirl you gotta show me (alright) *looks confused*\nYou remind me of something (uh)\nBut I don\u2019t know what it is right now (I don't know)\nYou remind me of something (uh)\nGirl you gotta show me\"\n\nWait, so that's what you were doing? That was your ace in the hole? Trying to turn your absentmindedness into the reason why she should have sex with you? Look, when I hear a song where someone's talking to a member of the opposite sex, I usually imagine what it would translate to in real life. And when I hear this, this is the only way it translates to me:\n\n\"Girl, you remind of... of something, but I don't remember what it was\u2026 so why don't you remind me\u2026 by having sex with me\u2026\n\nAs far as I can imagine, there's just no way to make this sexy. Unless of course, you're a well-known celebrity, in which case, the chorus could be interpreted like this:\n\nGirl, you remind me of, um\u2026 of, uh\u2026*girl: uh-huh?*... look, I'm rich and famous and I want to have sex with you. Can we just skip to the part where we\u2026 *girl: yeah, sure\u2026* Alright, let's go\n\nAnd with the obvious \"You could never say something this stupid to a girl unless you're as rich as me\" mentality that this chorus has been written in, it pulls me out of the song immediately\u2026 and we haven't even gotten to the rapper yet!\n\nUh, on the real no lie\nI don\u2019t know what it is but you just my\u2026\n\nOkay, I see we're just gonna get the same obliviously stupid mannerisms that we've heard on the chorus. in fact, I don't even know why I'm bothering. It's obvious that I'm not going to get anything clever from this song\n\nGot a cup in your hand (hand)\nBaby sitting but you ain\u2019t got no kids\n\nRhyming \"hand\"\u2026. with \"kids\"\u2026 You know what? This song is already promised a VERY low rating because of Mr. Brown over here, so unless there's some great payoff to that crappy chorus, it's not redeeming itself. So, come on, let's skip ahead to the lyric that says what she reminds him of, because there's no way they'd set up such a chorus without some punchline SOMEWHERE\n\nWe ain\u2019t leaving \u2019til there ain\u2019t no more left (yeah)\nCan\u2019t see no time on the Rolex\n\nYeah, yeah, your watch has so many diamonds, you can't see the time, everyone's said it, and you're not special. Keep going\n\nGo on the floor like a doormat (uh)\nBaby you know where to throw that\n\nWait\u2026 is that what she reminds him of, a doormat? Because she \"goes on the floor\"? Well, I hope not, because\u2026 calling a person a doormat, has\u2026 a bit of a negative connotation to it, so this can't be it, let's\u2026 keep going\n\nUh, so tell me what your name is\nI don\u2019t really care who you came with (no)\n\nNope, he doesn't bring\u2026 really, now? Is that what you're going to say to her?\n\n\"So, girl, what's your name?\"\n\"Well, I'm Kiesha, I just came with my best friends\u2026\"\n\"Haha, I don't care\u2026\"\n\nUnless you got a couple friends look like you\n\n\"That is, unless of course, your friends are hot, because then I'll want to have sex with them, too\u2026 and\u2026 by openly telling you this, I'm assuming it won't be a problem, because, I mean, when has a girl ever been jealous when a guy tries to talk to other women?\n\nMy bad if my ex try to fight you\n\nOh yeah\u2026\n\nOkay, I'm sick of this, and the way he thinks chatting up girls at the bar works is not helping, but that chorus still frustrates me, so I want to get to the point: what is the thing that she reminds him of? I have to know\n\nYou remind me of\u2026\n\nOh, here it is! Here's the thing she reminds him of! All will be revealed!\n\nYou remind me of something missing\nMisses, you got my full attention\n\nSo\u2026 she reminds him of\u2026 something missing, like in his life, which is a \"mrs.\", a spouse, a loving companion\u2026 WHAT A LOAD OF HORSE SHIT\n\nSo, this song was building up to him telling her she was wifey material? Oh, I'm sorry, maybe the fact that you were talking about pulling her panties to the side 2 minutes before you even asked what her freaking name was kinda threw me off!\n\nThis gets a 0 out of 5. It's crap. These lyrics are horrendously irredeemable, from the word go. The very first line of the chorus socks you with a bad taste in your mouth, and what follows are a bunch of lines that NO ONE would get away with in real life, so there's no connection you could make with it. The problem is that the way the chorus is written, with forgetting what he was going to say, sounds like it should have been played for laughs. But it's not. They wanted you to take that seriously as a slick pick-up line, There's nothing smooth about what he said, and there's nothing cool about it. It sounds like it was written by a bunch of jackasses who have no idea how human interaction works, and I just can't deal with it\n\nI'm the Rap Critic: you don't have to like my opinion, but man, fuck this song..."}, {"Title": "Doing It Wrong", "Artist": "Drake", "Lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world\nIt's just the end of a world that you had with one girl\nAnd she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting\nAnd it's all because she don't want things to change\n\n[Chorus]\nSo cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you\nThat's the wrong thing to do\nTouch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you\nThat's the wrong thing to do\nTalk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you\nThat's the wrong thing to do\nCause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying\nAnd say I love you, too\n\n[Bridge]\nBut I need someone different\nYou know it, oh ho, you know it\nOh ho, you know it, we both know it\nI need someone different\nYou know it, oh ho, you know it\nOh ho, you know it, we both know it\nSomething's been missing\nYou know it, oh ho, she knows it\nOh ho, I know it, we all know it\nI need someone different\n(Oh ho, oh ho)\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe live in a generation of not being in love\nAnd not being together\nBut we sure make it feel like we're together\nBecause we're scared to see each other with somebody else\n\n[Chorus]\nSo cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you\nThat's the wrong thing to do\nTouch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you\nThat's the wrong thing to do\nTalk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you\nThat's the wrong thing to do\nCause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying\nAnd say I love you, too\n\n[Bridge]\nBut I need someone different\nYou know it, oh ho, you know it\nOh ho, you know it, we both know it\nI need someone different\nYou know it, oh ho, you know it\nOh ho, you know it, we both know it\nSomething's been missing\nYou know it, oh ho, she knows it\nOh ho, I know it, we all know it\nI need someone different\n(Oh ho, oh ho)\n\n[Outro: Stevie Wonder on Harmonica]"}, {"Title": "Marvins Room", "Artist": "Drake", "Lyrics": "[Intro: Ericka Lee]\nHello?

I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because I have had strange ones of my own. Sympathies, I believe, exist (for instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the source to which each traces his origin) whose workings baffle mortal comprehension. And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with man.\n\nWhen I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she had been dreaming about a little child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either to one\u2019s self or one\u2019s kin. The saying might have worn out of my memory, had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix it there. The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her little sister.\n\nOf late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water. It was a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it nestled close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven successive nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.\n\nI did not like this iteration of one idea\u2014this strange recurrence of one image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the vision drew near. It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on the afternoon of the day following I was summoned downstairs by a message that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax\u2019s room. On repairing thither, I found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a gentleman\u2019s servant: he was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he held in his hand was surrounded with a crape band.\n\n\u201cI daresay you hardly remember me, Miss,\u201d he said, rising as I entered; \u201cbut my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Robert! how do you do? I remember you very well: you used to give me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana\u2019s bay pony. And how is Bessie? You are married to Bessie?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another little one about two months since\u2014we have three now\u2014and both mother and child are thriving.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd are the family well at the house, Robert?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sorry I can\u2019t give you better news of them, Miss: they are very badly at present\u2014in great trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope no one is dead,\u201d I said, glancing at his black dress. He too looked down at the crape round his hat and replied\u2014\n\n\u201cMr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. John?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how does his mother bear it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways, and his death was shocking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard from Bessie he was not doing well.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoing well! He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate amongst the worst men and the worst women. He got into debt and into jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he returned to his old companions and habits. His head was not strong: the knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard. He came down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all to him. Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by his extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he was dead. How he died, God knows!\u2014they say he killed himself.\u201d\n\nI was silent: the things were frightful. Robert Leaven resumed\u2014\n\n\u201cMissis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of poverty were quite breaking her down. The information about Mr. John\u2019s death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke. She was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making signs to my wife and mumbling. It was only yesterday morning, however, that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she made out the words, \u2018Bring Jane\u2014fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to her.\u2019 Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and advised them to send for you. The young ladies put it off at first; but their mother grew so restless, and said, \u2018Jane, Jane,\u2019 so many times, that at last they consented. I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think so too, Miss. Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse: but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; and I will do it now;\u201d and having directed him to the servants\u2019 hall, and recommended him to the care of John\u2019s wife, and the attentions of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.\n\nHe was not in any of the lower rooms; he was not in the yard, the stables, or the grounds. I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she had seen him;\u2014yes: she believed he was playing billiards with Miss Ingram. To the billiard-room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their admirers, were all busied in the game. It required some courage to disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could not defer, so I approached the master where he stood at Miss Ingram\u2019s side. She turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her eyes seemed to demand, \u201cWhat can the creeping creature want now?\u201d and when I said, in a low voice, \u201cMr. Rochester,\u201d she made a movement as if tempted to order me away. I remember her appearance at the moment\u2014it was very graceful and very striking: she wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure scarf was twisted in her hair. She had been all animation with the game, and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her haughty lineaments.\n\n\u201cDoes that person want you?\u201d she inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr. Rochester turned to see who the \u201cperson\u201d was. He made a curious grimace\u2014one of his strange and equivocal demonstrations\u2014threw down his cue and followed me from the room.\n\n\u201cWell, Jane?\u201d he said, as he rested his back against the schoolroom door, which he had shut.\n\n\u201cIf you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat to do?\u2014where to go?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo see a sick lady who has sent for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat sick lady?\u2014where does she live?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt Gateshead; in ---shire.\u201d\n\n\u201c-shire? That is a hundred miles off! Who may she be that sends for people to see her that distance?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer name is Reed, sir\u2014Mrs. Reed.\u201d\n\n\u201cReed of Gateshead? There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is his widow, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what have you to do with her? How do you know her?\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Reed was my uncle\u2014my mother\u2019s brother.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe deuce he was! You never told me that before: you always said you had no relations.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone that would own me, sir. Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast me off.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut Reed left children?\u2014you must have cousins? Sir George Lynn was talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago in London.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his family, and is supposed to have committed suicide. The news so shocked his mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what good can you do her? Nonsense, Jane! I would never think of running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead before you reach her: besides, you say she cast you off.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances were very different: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long will you stay?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs short a time as possible, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cPromise me only to stay a week\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt all events you will come back: you will not be induced under any pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no! I shall certainly return if all be well.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd who goes with you? You don\u2019t travel a hundred miles alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir, she has sent her coachman.\u201d\n\n\u201cA person to be trusted?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family.\u201d\n\nMr. Rochester meditated. \u201cWhen do you wish to go?\u201d\n\n\u201cEarly to-morrow morning, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you must have some money; you can\u2019t travel without money, and I daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet. How much have you in the world, Jane?\u201d he asked, smiling.\n\nI drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was. \u201cFive shillings, sir.\u201d He took the purse, poured the hoard into his palm, and chuckled over it as if its scantiness amused him. Soon he produced his pocket-book: \u201cHere,\u201d said he, offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he owed me but fifteen. I told him I had no change.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want change; you know that. Take your wages.\u201d\n\nI declined accepting more than was my due. He scowled at first; then, as if recollecting something, he said\u2014\n\n\u201cRight, right! Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay away three months if you had fifty pounds. There are ten; is it not plenty?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir, but now you owe me five.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to you while I have the opportunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cMatter of business? I am curious to hear it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be married?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; what then?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that case, sir, Ad\u00e8le ought to go to school: I am sure you will perceive the necessity of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo get her out of my bride\u2019s way, who might otherwise walk over her rather too emphatically? There\u2019s sense in the suggestion; not a doubt of it. Ad\u00e8le, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must march straight to\u2014the devil?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn course!\u201d he exclaimed, with a twang of voice and a distortion of features equally fantastic and ludicrous. He looked at me some minutes.\n\n\u201cAnd old Madam Reed, or the Misses, her daughters, will be solicited by you to seek a place, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify me in asking favours of them\u2014but I shall advertise.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!\u201d he growled. \u201cAt your peril you advertise! I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten pounds. Give me back nine pounds, Jane; I\u2019ve a use for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so have I, sir,\u201d I returned, putting my hands and my purse behind me. \u201cI could not spare the money on any account.\u201d\n\n\u201cLittle niggard!\u201d said he, \u201crefusing me a pecuniary request! Give me five pounds, Jane.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot five shillings, sir; nor five pence.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust let me look at the cash.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir; you are not to be trusted.\u201d\n\n\u201cJane!\u201d\n\n\u201cSir?\u201d\n\n\u201cPromise me one thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation to me. I\u2019ll find you one in time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will promise that I and Ad\u00e8le shall be both safe out of the house before your bride enters it.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well! very well! I\u2019ll pledge my word on it. You go to-morrow, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir; early.\u201d\n\n\u201cShall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, sir, I must prepare for the journey.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose so, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane? Teach me; I\u2019m not quite up to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen say it.\u201d\n\n\u201cFarewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat must I say?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe same, if you like, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cFarewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly. I should like something else: a little addition to the rite. If one shook hands, for instance; but no\u2014that would not content me either. So you\u2019ll do no more than say Farewell, Jane?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word as in many.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery likely; but it is blank and cool\u2014\u2018Farewell.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long is he going to stand with his back against that door?\u201d I asked myself; \u201cI want to commence my packing.\u201d The dinner-bell rang, and suddenly away he bolted, without another syllable: I saw him no more during the day, and was off before he had risen in the morning.\n\nI reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall. It was very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished bright, and the fire burnt clear. Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her last-born, and Robert and his sister played quietly in a corner.\n\n\u201cBless you!\u2014I knew you would come!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered.\n\n\u201cYes, Bessie,\u201d said I, after I had kissed her; \u201cand I trust I am not too late. How is Mrs. Reed?\u2014Alive still, I hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was. The doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she will finally recover.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas she mentioned me lately?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come, but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the house. She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and wakes up about six or seven. Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss, and then I will go up with you?\u201d\n\nRobert here entered, and Bessie laid her sleeping child in the cradle and went to welcome him: afterwards she insisted on my taking off my bonnet and having some tea; for she said I looked pale and tired. I was glad to accept her hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling garb just as passively as I used to let her undress me when a child.\n\nOld times crowded fast back on me as I watched her bustling about\u2014setting out the tea-tray with her best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an occasional tap or push, just as she used to give me in former days. Bessie had retained her quick temper as well as her light foot and good looks.\n\nTea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she desired me to sit still, quite in her old peremptory tones. I must be served at the fireside, she said; and she placed before me a little round stand with my cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she used to accommodate me with some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled and obeyed her as in bygone days.\n\nShe wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a person the mistress was; and when I told her there was only a master, whether he was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him. I told her he was rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he treated me kindly, and I was content. Then I went on to describe to her the gay company that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details Bessie listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she relished.\n\nIn such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my bonnet, &c., and, accompanied by her, I quitted the lodge for the hall. It was also accompanied by her that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked down the path I was now ascending. On a dark, misty, raw morning in January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered heart\u2014a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation\u2014to seek the chilly harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored. The same hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet; and I had yet an aching heart. I still felt as a wanderer on the face of the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own powers, and less withering dread of oppression. The gaping wound of my wrongs, too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished.\n\n\u201cYou shall go into the breakfast-room first,\u201d said Bessie, as she preceded me through the hall; \u201cthe young ladies will be there.\u201d\n\nIn another moment I was within that apartment. There was every article of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first introduced to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he had stood upon still covered the hearth. Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two volumes of Bewick\u2019s British Birds occupying their old place on the third shelf, and Gulliver\u2019s Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above. The inanimate objects were not changed; but the living things had altered past recognition.\n\nTwo young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as Miss Ingram\u2014very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien. There was something ascetic in her look, which was augmented by the extreme plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a string of ebony beads and a crucifix. This I felt sure was Eliza, though I could trace little resemblance to her former self in that elongated and colourless visage.\n\nThe other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I remembered\u2014the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven. This was a full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair. The hue of her dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from her sister\u2019s\u2014so much more flowing and becoming\u2014it looked as stylish as the other\u2019s looked puritanical.\n\nIn each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother\u2014and only one; the thin and pallid elder daughter had her parent\u2019s Cairngorm eye: the blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her contour of jaw and chin\u2014perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.\n\nBoth ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by the name of \u201cMiss Eyre.\u201d Eliza\u2019s greeting was delivered in a short, abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she sat down again, fixed her eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me. Georgiana added to her \u201cHow d\u2019ye do?\u201d several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on, uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry side-glances that measured me from head to foot\u2014now traversing the folds of my drab merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage bonnet. Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that they think you a \u201cquiz\u201d without actually saying the words. A certain superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone, express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by any positive rudeness in word or deed.\n\nA sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi-sarcastic attentions of the other\u2014Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana ruffle me. The fact was, I had other things to think about; within the last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than any they could raise\u2014pains and pleasures so much more acute and exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict or bestow\u2014that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.\n\n\u201cHow is Mrs. Reed?\u201d I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected liberty.\n\n\u201cMrs. Reed? Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you can see her to-night.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf,\u201d said I, \u201cyou would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I should be much obliged to you.\u201d\n\nGeorgiana almost started, and she opened her blue eyes wild and wide. \u201cI know she had a particular wish to see me,\u201d I added, \u201cand I would not defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary.\u201d\n\n\u201cMama dislikes being disturbed in an evening,\u201d remarked Eliza. I soon rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would just step out to Bessie\u2014who was, I dared say, in the kitchen\u2014and ask her to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to-night. I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her on my errand, I proceeded to take further measures. It had heretofore been my habit always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should, a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now, it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan. I had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I must stay with her till she was better\u2014or dead: as to her daughters\u2019 pride or folly, I must put it on one side, make myself independent of it. So I addressed the housekeeper; asked her to show me a room, told her I should probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk conveyed to my chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the landing.\n\n\u201cMissis is awake,\u201d said she; \u201cI have told her you are here: come and let us see if she will know you.\u201d\n\nI did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days. I hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on the table, for it was now getting dark. There was the great four-post bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the armchair, and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted. I looked into a certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck. I approached the bed; I opened the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.\n\nWell did I remember Mrs. Reed\u2019s face, and I eagerly sought the familiar image. It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion. I had left this woman in bitterness and hate, and I came back to her now with no other emotion than a sort of ruth for her great sufferings, and a strong yearning to forget and forgive all injuries\u2014to be reconciled and clasp hands in amity.\n\nThe well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever\u2014there was that peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised, imperious, despotic eyebrow. How often had it lowered on me menace and hate! and how the recollection of childhood\u2019s terrors and sorrows revived as I traced its harsh line now! And yet I stooped down and kissed her: she looked at me.\n\n\u201cIs this Jane Eyre?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYes, Aunt Reed. How are you, dear aunt?\u201d\n\nI had once vowed that I would never call her aunt again: I thought it no sin to forget and break that vow now. My fingers had fastened on her hand which lay outside the sheet: had she pressed mine kindly, I should at that moment have experienced true pleasure. But unimpressionable natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily eradicated. Mrs. Reed took her hand away, and, turning her face rather from me, she remarked that the night was warm. Again she regarded me so icily, I felt at once that her opinion of me\u2014her feeling towards me\u2014was unchanged and unchangeable. I knew by her stony eye\u2014opaque to tenderness, indissoluble to tears\u2014that she was resolved to consider me bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her no generous pleasure: only a sense of mortification.\n\nI felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to subdue her\u2014to be her mistress in spite both of her nature and her will. My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their source. I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over the pillow.\n\n\u201cYou sent for me,\u201d I said, \u201cand I am here; and it is my intention to stay till I see how you get on.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, of course! You have seen my daughters?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a difficulty in recalling them. But there was something I wished to say\u2014let me see\u2014\u201d\n\nThe wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place in her once vigorous frame. Turning restlessly, she drew the bedclothes round her; my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down: she was at once irritated.\n\n\u201cSit up!\u201d said she; \u201cdon\u2019t annoy me with holding the clothes fast. Are you Jane Eyre?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am Jane Eyre.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe. Such a burden to be left on my hands\u2014and so much annoyance as she caused me, daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one\u2019s movements! I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a fiend\u2014no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her away from the house. What did they do with her at Lowood? The fever broke out there, and many of the pupils died. She, however, did not die: but I said she did\u2014I wish she had died!\u201d\n\n\u201cA strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband\u2019s only sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family\u2019s disowning her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her death, he wept like a simpleton. He would send for the baby; though I entreated him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance. I hated it the first time I set my eyes on it\u2014a sickly, whining, pining thing! It would wail in its cradle all night long\u2014not screaming heartily like any other child, but whimpering and moaning. Reed pitied it; and he used to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than he ever noticed his own at that age. He would try to make my children friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and he was angry with them when they showed their dislike. In his last illness, he had it brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before he died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature. I would as soon have been charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally weak. John does not at all resemble his father, and I am glad of it: John is like me and like my brothers\u2014he is quite a Gibson. Oh, I wish he would cease tormenting me with letters for money? I have no more money to give him: we are getting poor. I must send away half the servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off. I can never submit to do that\u2014yet how are we to get on? Two-thirds of my income goes in paying the interest of mortgages. John gambles dreadfully, and always loses\u2014poor boy! He is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and degraded\u2014his look is frightful\u2014I feel ashamed for him when I see him.\u201d\n\nShe was getting much excited. \u201cI think I had better leave her now,\u201d said I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.\n\n\u201cPerhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards night\u2014in the morning she is calmer.\u201d\n\nI rose. \u201cStop!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Reed, \u201cthere is another thing I wished to say. He threatens me\u2014he continually threatens me with his own death, or mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face. I am come to a strange pass: I have heavy troubles. What is to be done? How is the money to be had?\u201d\n\nBessie now endeavoured to persuade her to take a sedative draught: she succeeded with difficulty. Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed, and sank into a dozing state. I then left her.\n\nMore than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her. She continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade everything which could painfully excite her. Meantime, I got on as well as I could with Georgiana and Eliza. They were very cold, indeed, at first. Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and scarcely utter a word either to me or her sister. Georgiana would chatter nonsense to her canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of me. But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they served me for both.\n\nProvided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk; a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad\u2019s head, crowned with lotus-flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow\u2019s nest, under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.\n\nOne morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be, I did not care or know. I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad point, and worked away. Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features. Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and waved above the forehead. Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last, because they required the most careful working. I drew them large; I shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids lustrous and large. \u201cGood! but not quite the thing,\u201d I thought, as I surveyed the effect: \u201cthey want more force and spirit;\u201d and I wrought the shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly\u2014a happy touch or two secured success. There, I had a friend\u2019s face under my gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs on me? I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed and content.\n\n\u201cIs that a portrait of some one you know?\u201d asked Eliza, who had approached me unnoticed. I responded that it was merely a fancy head, and hurried it beneath the other sheets. Of course, I lied: it was, in fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester. But what was that to her, or to any one but myself? Georgiana also advanced to look. The other drawings pleased her much, but she called that \u201can ugly man.\u201d They both seemed surprised at my skill. I offered to sketch their portraits; and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline. Then Georgiana produced her album. I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her at once into good humour. She proposed a walk in the grounds. Before we had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she had spent in London two seasons ago\u2014of the admiration she had there excited\u2014the attention she had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest she had made. In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of fashionable life was that day improvised by her for my benefit. The communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same theme\u2014herself, her loves, and woes. It was strange she never once adverted either to her mother\u2019s illness, or her brother\u2019s death, or the present gloomy state of the family prospects. Her mind seemed wholly taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after dissipations to come. She passed about five minutes each day in her mother\u2019s sick-room, and no more.\n\nEliza still spoke little: she had evidently no time to talk. I never saw a busier person than she seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what she did: or rather, to discover any result of her diligence. She had an alarm to call her up early. I know not how she occupied herself before breakfast, but after that meal she divided her time into regular portions, and each hour had its allotted task. Three times a day she studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer Book. I asked her once what was the great attraction of that volume, and she said, \u201cthe Rubric.\u201d Three hours she gave to stitching, with gold thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a carpet. In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, she informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately erected near Gateshead. Two hours she devoted to her diary; two to working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of her accounts. She seemed to want no company; no conversation. I believe she was happy in her way: this routine sufficed for her; and nothing annoyed her so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her to vary its clockwork regularity.\n\nShe told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than usual, that John\u2019s conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had been a source of profound affliction to her: but she had now, she said, settled her mind, and formed her resolution. Her own fortune she had taken care to secure; and when her mother died\u2014and it was wholly improbable, she tranquilly remarked, that she should either recover or linger long\u2014she would execute a long-cherished project: seek a retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous world. I asked if Georgiana would accompany her.\n\n\u201cOf course not. Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had had. She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration. Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers.\u201d\n\nGeorgiana, when not unburdening her heart to me, spent most of her time in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and wishing over and over again that her aunt Gibson would send her an invitation up to town. \u201cIt would be so much better,\u201d she said, \u201cif she could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over.\u201d I did not ask what she meant by \u201call being over,\u201d but I suppose she referred to the expected decease of her mother and the gloomy sequel of funeral rites. Eliza generally took no more notice of her sister\u2019s indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had been before her. One day, however, as she put away her account-book and unfolded her embroidery, she suddenly took her up thus\u2014\n\n\u201cGeorgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never allowed to cumber the earth. You had no right to be born, for you make no use of life. Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some other person\u2019s strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that you are ill-treated, neglected, miserable. Then, too, existence for you must be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be flattered\u2014you must have music, dancing, and society\u2014or you languish, you die away. Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own? Take one day; share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes\u2014include all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid regularity. The day will close almost before you are aware it has begun; and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant moment: you have had to seek no one\u2019s company, conversation, sympathy, forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to do. Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you; then you will not want me or any one else, happen what may. Neglect it\u2014go on as heretofore, craving, whining, and idling\u2014and suffer the results of your idiocy, however bad and insuperable they may be. I tell you this plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now about to say, I shall steadily act on it. After my mother\u2019s death, I wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is carried to the vault in Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had never known each other. You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest claim: I can tell you this\u2014if the whole human race, ourselves excepted, were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you in the old world, and betake myself to the new.\u201d\n\nShe closed her lips.\n\n\u201cYou might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,\u201d answered Georgiana. \u201cEverybody knows you are the most selfish, heartless creature in existence: and I know your spiteful hatred towards me: I have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about Lord Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your face, and so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever.\u201d Georgiana took out her handkerchief and blew her nose for an hour afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.\n\nTrue, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably savourless for the want of it. Feeling without judgment is a washy draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and husky a morsel for human deglutition.\n\nIt was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint\u2019s-day service at the new church\u2014for in matters of religion she was a rigid formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she considered her devotional duties; fair or foul, she went to church thrice every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers.\n\nI bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her but a remittent attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of the room whenever she could. Bessie was faithful; but she had her own family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall. I found the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her livid face sunk in the pillows: the fire was dying in the grate. I renewed the fuel, re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her who could not now gaze on me, and then I moved away to the window.\n\nThe rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously: \u201cOne lies there,\u201d I thought, \u201cwho will soon be beyond the war of earthly elements. Whither will that spirit\u2014now struggling to quit its material tenement\u2014flit when at length released?\u201d\n\nIn pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her dying words\u2014her faith\u2014her doctrine of the equality of disembodied souls. I was still listening in thought to her well-remembered tones\u2014still picturing her pale and spiritual aspect, her wasted face and sublime gaze, as she lay on her placid deathbed, and whispered her longing to be restored to her divine Father\u2019s bosom\u2014when a feeble voice murmured from the couch behind: \u201cWho is that?\u201d\n\nI knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she reviving? I went up to her.\n\n\u201cIt is I, Aunt Reed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2014I?\u201d was her answer. \u201cWho are you?\u201d looking at me with surprise and a sort of alarm, but still not wildly. \u201cYou are quite a stranger to me\u2014where is Bessie?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is at the lodge, aunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cAunt,\u201d she repeated. \u201cWho calls me aunt? You are not one of the Gibsons; and yet I know you\u2014that face, and the eyes and forehead, are quiet familiar to me: you are like\u2014why, you are like Jane Eyre!\u201d\n\nI said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my identity.\n\n\u201cYet,\u201d said she, \u201cI am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me. I wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists: besides, in eight years she must be so changed.\u201d I now gently assured her that I was the person she supposed and desired me to be: and seeing that I was understood, and that her senses were quite collected, I explained how Bessie had sent her husband to fetch me from Thornfield.\n\n\u201cI am very ill, I know,\u201d she said ere long. \u201cI was trying to turn myself a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb. It is as well I should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in health, burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me. Is the nurse here? or is there no one in the room but you?\u201d\n\nI assured her we were alone.\n\n\u201cWell, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now. One was in breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own child; the other\u2014\u201d she stopped. \u201cAfter all, it is of no great importance, perhaps,\u201d she murmured to herself: \u201cand then I may get better; and to humble myself so to her is painful.\u201d\n\nShe made an effort to alter her position, but failed: her face changed; she seemed to experience some inward sensation\u2014the precursor, perhaps, of the last pang.\n\n\u201cWell, I must get it over. Eternity is before me: I had better tell her.\u2014Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see there.\u201d\n\nI obeyed her directions. \u201cRead the letter,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was short, and thus conceived:\u2014\n\n\u201cMadam,\u2014Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is? It is my intention to write shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira. Providence has blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried and childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at my death whatever I may have to leave.\u2014I am, Madam, &c., &c.,\n\n\u201cJohn Eyre, Madeira.\u201d\n\nIt was dated three years back.\n\n\u201cWhy did I never hear of this?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cBecause I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in lifting you to prosperity. I could not forget your conduct to me, Jane\u2014the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable cruelty. I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an animal that I had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me in a man\u2019s voice.\u2014Bring me some water! Oh, make haste!\u201d\n\n\u201cDear Mrs. Reed,\u201d said I, as I offered her the draught she required, \u201cthink no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind. Forgive me for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have passed since that day.\u201d\n\nShe heeded nothing of what I said; but when she had tasted the water and drawn breath, she went on thus\u2014\n\n\u201cI tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was what I could not endure. I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at Lowood. Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion\u2014expose my falsehood as soon as you like. You were born, I think, to be my torment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which, but for you, I should never have been tempted to commit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to regard me with kindness and forgiveness\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a very bad disposition,\u201d said she, \u201cand one to this day I feel it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and violence, I can never comprehend.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not vindictive. Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled to you now: kiss me, aunt.\u201d\n\nI approached my cheek to her lips: she would not touch it. She said I oppressed her by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water. As I laid her down\u2014for I raised her and supported her on my arm while she drank\u2014I covered her ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble fingers shrank from my touch\u2014the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.\n\n\u201cLove me, then, or hate me, as you will,\u201d I said at last, \u201cyou have my full and free forgiveness: ask now for God\u2019s, and be at peace.\u201d\n\nPoor, suffering woman! it was too late for her to make now the effort to change her habitual frame of mind: living, she had ever hated me\u2014dying, she must hate me still.\n\nThe nurse now entered, and Bessie followed. I yet lingered half-an-hour longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she gave none. She was fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her mind again rally: at twelve o\u2019clock that night she died. I was not present to close her eyes, nor were either of her daughters. They came to tell us the next morning that all was over. She was by that time laid out. Eliza and I went to look at her: Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she dared not go. There was stretched Sarah Reed\u2019s once robust and active frame, rigid and still: her eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her brow and strong traits wore yet the impress of her inexorable soul. A strange and solemn object was that corpse to me. I gazed on it with gloom and pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for her woes\u2014not my loss\u2014and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a form.\n\nEliza surveyed her parent calmly. After a silence of some minutes she observed\u2014\n\n\u201cWith her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life was shortened by trouble.\u201d And then a spasm constricted her mouth for an instant: as it passed away she turned and left the room, and so did I.

cut with a crush that's a trip\nStill, he can't stop me from having daydreams\nTonguin' you down with, uh, vanilla ice cream\nKissing on your thighs in the moonlight\nSearchin' your body with my tongue, girl, all night\nI wonder one day could it be, simple dreams turnin' into reality\nOur love would come down so naturally\nWe would walk down the aisle of destiny\nWhat your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared\nBreak ya off a little chump change to do your hair\nThat seems to be enough to satisfy your needs\nBut there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead\nHey lover\n\n[Chorus:

touched you gently with my hands\nWe talked about travelin' the distant lands\nEscapin' all the madness out here in the world\nBecomin' my wife, no longer my girl\nThen, you let your dress fall down to the floor\nI kissed you softly and you yearned for more\nWe experienced pleasure unparallel\nInto an ocean of love, we both fell\nSwimmin' in the timeless, currents of pure bliss\nFantasies interchangin' with each kiss\nUndyin' passion unities our souls\nTogether we swim until the point of no control, but\nIt's a fantasy it (that, you) won't come true\nWe never even spoke and your man swear he love you\nSo I'm a keep all these feelin's inside\nKeep my dreams alive until the right time\n\n[Chorus: Boyz II Men]\nHey lover, hey lover, this is more than a crush\nHey lover, hey lover,

Christ-like\nNigga I ain't psychic\nI know it's all a cycle and everybody bike it\nAnd France is enormous you're Lance with endorsements\nBut you might need a hand to enhance your performance\nConsider this a kilogram of encouragement\nTeach you how to sneak it past the enforcement\nAnd when you get it through in a manner so cool\nRemember to give a little nod to the old school\nWassup...\n\n[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]\nGive me your old school love right now\nI'm leaving it all up to you darling, giving you everything you want\nAnd give me that old school love right now\nYou know that only you and me alone...\n\n[Hook: Ed Sheeran]\nAs long as I'm here, as long as you love me\nGive me that old school love right now\nAs long as I'm here, as long as you love me\nGive me that old school love right now"}, {"Title": "So Sick", "Artist": "Kurt Hugo Schneider", "Lyrics": "Adele -

(When you take out your braids)\nDoes she know that you like to play PS2 'til 6 in the morning like I do?\n\n[Chorus: Paula DeAnda & Divine]\nI can't explain this feeling (Yeah)\nI think about it every day\nAnd even though we've moved on (Uh-huh)\nIt gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)\nWalk away (Forever you will live in my memory)\nWalk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)\nWalk away (I can't forget how we used to be)\n\n[Verse 3: Paula DeAnda]\nGuess I gotta live my life from day to day\nHoping maybe you'll come back\nAnd though I tell myself not to be afraid\nTo move on, but it seems I can't\nThough a new man has given me attention\nIt ain't the same as your affection\nThough I know I should be content\nIn the back of my mind, I can't help but question\nDoes he kiss me on the forehead? (Before we play)\nShow up on my doorstep? (With a bouquet)\nDoes he call me in the middle of the day just to say, \"Baby, I love you\" (Like you used to?)\n\n[Chorus: Paula DeAnda & Divine]\nI can't explain this feeling (Yeah)\nI think about it every day\nAnd even though we've moved on (Uh-huh)\nIt gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)\nWalk away (Forever you will live in my memory)\nWalk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)\nWalk away (I can't forget how we used to be)\n\n[Verse 4: Divine, Paula DeAnda, Both]\nI'm gonna remember you (You're gonna remember me)\nThe things we did, the way we shared our fantasies\nJust you and me; my friend, my love, my family\nHow did we lose a love that seemed meant to be?\nSometimes I kiss her and wish that it was you I'm kissing\nSometimes I miss him and wish that it was you I'm missing\nSometimes I hug her and wish that it was you I was hugging\nAnd I realize how much I'm bugging\nI miss you\n\n[Bridge: Paula DeAnda & Divine]\nSo hard to express this feeling\n'Cause nobody compares to you (To you)\nAnd you know she'll never love you like I do (Yeah)\n\n[Chorus: Paula DeAnda, Divine, Both]\nI can't explain this feeling (Uh-uh)\nI think about it every day (Yeah)\nAnd even though we've moved on (Yeah)\nIt gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me) (Walk away)\nWalk away (Walk away)\nWalk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me) (I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, no...)\nI can't explain this feeling (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)\nI think about it every day (Forever you will live in my memory)\nAnd even though we've moved on (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)\nIt gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)\nWalk away (Forever you will live in my memory) (?)\nWalk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)\nWalk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember

My name is Tim Huong and on behalf of the Harvard Speech and Parliamentary Debate Society I'd like to welcome you all tonight to \"Israel and Palestine after Disengagement: Where Do We Go From Here?\" While we as an undergraduate group are usually involved with competitions around the world we are particularly interested in promoting public debate and dialogue on campus, and tonight marks the first of many such events planned for the Harvard community.\n\nNow, the support throughout the entire of the university has been overwhelming, and I'd like to take a moment to thank all our cosponsors. These are the Harvard Students for Israel, The Palestinian Solidarity Committee, The Progressive Jewish Alliance, The Harvard Society of Arab Students, The Jewish Law Students' Association, Justice For Palestine, Alliance for Israel; and in the Kennedy School of Government, the Arab, Jewish and Muslim Caucuses, Students for Israel, Palestine Awareness Committee, and the Jewish Muslim Dialogue.\n\nI'd also like to give special thanks to Bill White and the IOP Forum staff for their really, frankly, invaluable help in putting this project together for us. And now, I'll leave it to Brian to introduce the speakers tonight, but, suffice it to say, you're about to witness a remarkable discussion between, really, truly two of the most prominent thinkers in the ongoing discussion for peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nSo without further adieu, I am proud, very proud, to present this event tonight, and we hope you enjoy it.\n\nAnd now it is my pleasure to turn the program over to tonight's moderator, Professor Brian Mandell. Professor Mandell is a lecturer at the JFK School of Government and he directs the school's negotiations project.\n\nBrian?\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Thank you. Thanks, Tim, and good evening everyone and welcome to the John F. Kennedy, Jr. Forum.\n\nOne of the missions of this school is to train public leaders to think hard about critical issues of the day. Certainly this evening we are going to be addressing, confronting and thinking hard about some of those issues as they relate to Israel and Palestine.\n\nTonight, our critical issue is--to bring it to point--is \"Israel and Palestine after Disengagement: Where Do We Go From Here?\" As we know, both parties, Israelis and Palestinians, are shortly headed toward elections. In January for the Palestinians, probably in late March for the Israelis.\n\nSince the disengagement in August, both sides are wrestling mightily with their internal constituents, some on board for peace, some reluctant, some not so anxious at all to proceed with what is still an unknown and uncertain future. But there is a ray of hope if you've read the papers in the past couple days: an Israeli-Palestinian Peace soccer team, a joint team, has shown up in Spain. What's interesting about this is that beneath the rhetoric, beneath the politics, there is a level of humanity in both suffering and hope, that these two peoples will soon join hands and produce a better and a different path. And tonight I think we're here to discuss what that path might look like.\n\nWhat I want to do before introducing our two speakers is to make clear what our format is for this discussion. First, each speaker will make a 10 minute opening statement on the topic. Then, for approximately 45 minutes or so I will moderate a question and answer session from you, the audience. We will conclude with two minute closing statements from each speaker. And while I encourage you to ask any question you deem appropriate to Professors Chomsky and Dershowitz--and I include in that tough questions-I also ask for the sake of the audience that you be brief and respect the right of each speaker to respond as well. Please remember that civility is the cornerstone of our democracy, and certainly a hallmark here at the Forum.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, Professor Alan Dershowitz graduated from Brooklyn College and Yale Law School. At Yale he graduated first in his class and served as editor-in-chief of the Yale Law Review. After clerking for Chief Judge David Freslin (sp?) and Justice Arthur Goldberg, he was appointed to the Harvard Law faculty at age 25 (there wasn't even time for you to join a mid-career program here at the school) and he became a full professor at 28, the youngest in the school's history. When not teaching students he found time to be one of the country's most accomplished defense lawyers and authored over 20 books. His latest, The Case for Peace: How the Arab-Israeli Conflict Can Be Solved, has received favorable reviews from former President Bill Clinton and Middle East negotiator Dennis Ross. At Harvard Law School, where he is the Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law, Professor Dershowitz teaches courses in criminal law; constitutional litigation; civil liberties; and violence, legal ethics and human rights.\n\nProfessor Noam Chomsky: son of a Hebrew scholar, Professor Chomsky was born in Philadelphia. While he acquired his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1955, much of his research leading to his degree was done here at Harvard between 1951 and 1955. In 1955, he joined M.I.T., and in '61 was appointed full professor in the Department of Modern Languages and Linguistics. From his articulate opposition to the Vietnam War in the mid '60's, to his book, Manufacturing Consent in 1988, and to his even more challenging text, 9-11, published after the terrorists attack that year, Noam Chomsky has never retreated from taking on the most pressing issues of our day. Professor Chomsky is the Institute Professor of Linguistics at M.I.T., and teaches classes in linguistic theory, syntax, semantics, and the philosophy of language.\n\nBefore we begin, and to set the appropriate tone and context for this evening, I'd like us to have a brief look at a short clip from a forum event last year.\n\n(CLIP BEGINS)\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, my name is Laura Daghi, I'm a Junior in the college, and I was wondering, as a leader who is internationally recognized in the struggle for peace, what advice do you have for the rising leaders of our generation?\n\nShimon Peres: First of all, don't be like us. Be different. You know, personally, I have very little patience for history. I believe that to imagine is more important than to remember.\n\n(CLIP ENDS)\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Let me just repeat that so that we have that as the tone and the context for our discussion tonight. And I quote from Shimon Peres: 'First of all, don't be like us. Be different. Personally, I have very little patience for history. I believe that to imagine is more important to remember\". So tonight let us imagine what should be the next steps in the process of achieving peace in the Middle East.\n\nFor your knowledge, a coin toss conducted by the Harvard Speech and Parliamentary Debate Society has determined that Professor Dershowitz will speak first for 10 minutes. After that, we will go to, directly to Professor Chomsky and then the floor will be open. Professor Dershowitz.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Thank you very much. It's a great honor for me to be participating in a debate with a man who has been called the world's top public intellectual. My connections to Noam Chomsky go back a long time. In the 1940s, I was a camper, and he a counselor in a Hebrew-speaking Zionist camp in the Pocono Mountains called Camp Massad. In the 1960s we both worked against the Vietnam War. In the 1970s, we had the first of our many debates about the Arab-Israeli conflict. I advocated ending the Israeli occupation in exchange for peace and recognition of Israel; he advocated a one-state solution, modeled on Lebanon and Yugoslavia. We debated again in the 1980s and the 1990s. I have the text. I hope that our once-a-decade encounter will continue for many decades to come, though I doubt we will agree with each other.\n\nThe debate today occurs at a time of real potential for peace. Shimon Peres, Israel's elder statesman in the peace camp, today quit the Labour Party and announced his support for Ariel Sharon in the upcoming election. Quote: \"In my eyes, it is not a problem of parties, but a problem of peace, how to create a strong coalition for peace. The elements are now in place for a real peace.\" As I wrote in The Case for Peace, when the Palestinian leadership wants a Palestinian state more than it wants to see the destruction of Israel, there will finally be a two-state solution.\n\nThe untimely death of Yasser Arafat makes the two-state solution a real possibility. I call Arafat's death untimely, because if it had occurred five years earlier, we might now be celebrating the anniversary of Palestinian statehood. Arafat's decision to turn down the Clinton-Barak plan for Palestinian statehood was characterized by Prince Bandar of Saudi Arabia as, quote, \"a crime against the Palestinians, in fact against the entire region.\" The crime and the death that it needlessly caused can never be undone, but this is a time to move forward and to assure that the crime is not repeated.\n\nThe time has come for compromise. My friend, Amos Oz, the great novelist and leader of the Israeli peace movement, has said there are two possible resolutions to a conflict of this kind: the Shakespearian and the Chekhovian. In a Shakespear drama, every right is wronged, every act is revenged, every injustice is made right, and perfect justice prevails, but at the end of the play, everybody lies dead on the stage. In a Chekhov play, everybody is disillusioned, embittered, heart-broken, and disappointed, but they remain alive. We need a Chekhovian resolution for the Arab-Israeli tragedy.\n\nThis will require the elevation of pragmatism over ideology. It will require that both sides give up rights. Rights. Giving up rights is a hard thing to do. It will require that each side recognizes and acknowledges the pain and the suffering of the other. And it will require an end to the hateful attitudes and speech that some on each side direct against the other.\n\nSometimes it's better to start at the end. The ultimate solution is not as much in dispute these days as is the means for getting there. I believe that even Professor Chomsky and I have the same basic agreement about a number of very important elements of what a pragmatic resolution might look like. Professor Chomsky now acknowledges that the two-state solution may be, quote, \"the best of the rotten ideas around.\" I'll settle for that. He also seems to acknowledge that those who advocate the so-called Palestinian right of return are pandering to their people and misleading them into believing that there is yet another weapon, a demographic weapon, that can destroy Israel. I think we both agree that Jerusalem should be divided essentially along demographic lines with the Palestinians controlling the Palestinian population and Israel controlling the Jewish population, that the borders between Israel and the Palestinian state should be based roughly on the U.N. Resolution 242, that Israel properly ended its occupation of the Gaza, and that it should end its occupation of all Palestinian cities and population centers on the West Bank, that terrorism must stop, and that the Palestinian state that results from this peace must be as contiguous as possible, and economically and politically viable.\n\nThere remain considerable differences between us and, more importantly, between the Israeli government and the Palestinian authority that must resolve these issues and actually sit down and make peace. Some of these differences are attitudinal. I believe that peace is a realistic possibility, whereas Professor Chomsky apparently believes there is no chance for peace, at least as reflected by the German title of his new book, Keine Chance f\u00fcr Frieden, which translates as No Chance for Peace: Why a Palestinian State is Not Possible to be Established with Israel and the United States. I hope you're wrong.\n\nOther differences are quite specific, relating to precise boundaries and considerations that are quite important, the devil always being in the details. I strongly believe, however, that there is a genuine will for peace on both sides now and that the pragmatic differences can and will be resolved. And here, I think the academy can play a very important and positive role in fostering peace. At the moment, I'm sad to report that many academics around the world are contributing to an atmosphere that makes peace more difficult to achieve. They are encouraging those Palestinians who see the end of Israel as their ultimate goal to persist in their ideological and terrorist campaign.\n\nBy demonizing and de-legitimating Israel in the international community and on university campuses throughout the world, they send a doubly destructive message to those who must make peace on the ground. To the Palestinians, the message is don't compromise. If you hold out long enough, the next generation of leaders will buy into your efforts to de-legitimate Israel and will give you the total victory you seek. To the Israelis, the message is: Whatever you do in the name of compromise, you will continue to be attacked, demonized, divested from, boycotted and de-legitimated, so why make the compromise efforts?\n\nAs I travel around college campuses in the United States, I notice a stark difference. Many of those who support the Palestinian cause tend to be virulently opposed to Israel, comparing the Jewish state to Nazism and apartheid, comparing Shimon Peres to Hitler and Idi Amin, calling Israel the world's worst human rights violators, and suggesting that Israel should be flattered by a comparison with the Gestapo. These are all quotes, the Amin/Hitler quote from Professor Chomsky, the comparison with Gestapo from Norman Finkelstein. Whereas most of those on the Israeli side tend to be supportive of a peaceful Palestinian state. Put another way, pro-Palestinians tend to be anti-Israel, whereas pro-Israelis are often pro-Palestinian, as well.\n\nIt was not the Israelis who scuttled the United Nations' two-state solution in 1948 and themselves originally occupied Gaza and the West Bank with little or no objection from the international community. That was Egypt and Jordan. It was not the Israelis who turned down Resolution 242 in 1967 with the famous three no's: no negotiation, no peace and no recognition. As Abba Eban put it, this is the first time in history that the side who won the war sued for peace, and the side that lost the war demanded unconditional surrender. It was not Israel that turned down the generous offer at Camp David in Taba. The Palestinian leadership has never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity, but it is not too late for peace now.\n\nI wish to end my opening remarks today by making a specific proposal directed to my distinguished opponent. I propose here today a peace treaty among academics who purport to favor peace between Israel and the Palestinians. I believe that by agreeing to this peace treaty and by implementing it, academics can actually contribute to encouraging a pragmatic peace. I call today for those who have supported the Palestinian cause to stop demonizing Israel, to stop de-legitimating Israel, to stop defaming Israel, to stop applying a double standard to Israel, to stop divestiture and boycotts of Israel, and most importantly, to stop being more Palestinian than the Palestinians themselves.\n\nI call on academics who support Israel not to call for a greater Israel, nor to call for a continuation of the occupation of Palestinian cities, to stop being more Israeli than the Israelis themselves, and to join the vast majority of Israeli and American supporters of Israel who favor the two-state solution. If the two elder statesmen of Israel, Sharon and Peres, can place pragmatism before ideology and peace before party and come together toward the center in the interest of a pragmatic peace, then surely two elder statesmen of the American academic debate over Israel, who share this platform tonight, can also make our contribution to the peace process by encouraging those who respect us and sometimes follow our guidance to move closer to the center and closer to accepting a pragmatic, non-ideological resolution of this bitter conflict. Ecclesiastes many years ago said, \"To everything there is a season, a time to throw stones, a time to gather stones, a time for war and a time for peace.\" This is the season of peace. Let us not let it pass us by. Thank you very much.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Thank you, Professor Dershowitz. Professor Chomsky.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Mr. Mandell will confirm, there was an explicit condition for this debate. That is, that neither participant try to evade the issue by deceitful allegations about the other. So, I, therefore, congratulate Mr. Dershowitz on having made a true statement. I was a counselor at Massad. About the rest, there happens to be an ample record in print, or if you like, you can ask a question, but I'll keep to the topic and the rules.\n\nThe topic is: Where do we go from here? The answer to that is largely up to us. Evidently, it requires some understanding of how we got here. The question of where we're going now has a clear answer. It's given accurately by the leading academic specialist on the occupation, Harvard's Sara Roy, as she writes that under the terms of disengagement, Gazans are virtually sealed within the Strip, while West Bankers, their lands dismembered by relentless Israeli settlement, will continue to be penned into fragmented geographic spaces, isolated behind and between walls and barriers.\n\nHer judgment is affirmed by Israel's leading specialist on the West Bank, Meron Benvenisti, who writes that 'the separation walls snaking through the West Bank will create three Bantustans (his words): north, central and south, all virtually separated from East Jerusalem, the center of Palestinian commercial, cultural and political life. And he adds that this, what he calls the soft transfer from Jerusalem, that is an unavoidable result of the separation wall, might achieve its goal. Quoting still, 'the goal of disintegration of the Palestinian community, after many earlier attempts, have failed.' 'The human disaster being planned,' he continues, 'will turn hundreds of thousands of people into a sullen community, hostile, and nurturing a desire for revenge.' So, another example of the sacrifice of security through expansion that's been going on for a long time.\n\nA European Union report concludes that U.S.-backed Israeli programs will virtually end the prospects for a viable Palestinian state by the cantonization and by breaking the organic links between East Jerusalem and the West Bank. Human Rights Watch, in a recent statement, concurs.\n\nThere was no effort to conceal the fact that Gaza disengagement was in reality West Bank expansion. The official plan for disengagement stated that Israel will permanently take over major population centers, cities, towns and villages, security areas and other places of special interest to Israel in the West Bank. That was endorsed by the U.S. ambassador, as it had been by the President, breaking sharply with U.S. policy.\n\nAlong with the disengagement plan, Israel announced investment of tens of millions of dollars in West Bank settlements. Prime Minister Sharon immediately approved new housing units in the town of Maale Adumim--that's to the east of Jerusalem--the core of the salient that divides the southern from the central Bantustan, to use Benvenisti's term, and also announced other expansion plans.\n\nThere is near unanimity that all of this violates international law. The consensus was expressed by U.S. Judge Buergenthal in his separate declaration attached to the World Court judgment, ruling that the separation wall is illegal. In Buergenthal's words, \"The Fourth Geneva Convention and International Human Rights Law are applicable to the occupied Palestinian territory and must therefore be fully complied with by Israel. Accordingly, the segments of the wall being built by Israel to protect the settlements are ipso facto in violation of international humanitarian law,\" which happens to mean about 80% of the wall.\n\nTwo months later, Israel's high court rejected that judgment, ruling that the separation wall, quoting, \"must take into account the need to provide security for Israelis living in the West Bank, including their property rights.\" This is consistent with Chief Justice's Barak's doctrine that Israeli law supersedes international law, particularly in East Jerusalem, annexed in violation of Security Council orders. And practically speaking, he is correct, as long as the United States continues to provide the required economic, military and diplomatic support, as it has been doing for 30 years, in violation of the international consensus on a two-state settlement.\n\nYou can find detailed documentation about all of this in work of mine and others who have supported the international consensus for 30 years in print, explicitly. In Israeli literature, like Benny Morris's histories, you can find ample evidence about the nature of the occupation. In Morris's words, \"founded on brute force, repression and fear, collaboration and treachery, beatings and torture chambers and daily intimidation, humiliation and manipulation, along with stealing of valuable land and resources.\" Like other Israeli political and legal commentators, Morris reserves special criticism for the Supreme Court, whose record, he writes, \"will surely go down as a dark day in the annals of Israel's judicial system.\"\n\nKeeping to the diplomatic record, the first -- both sides, of course, rejected 242. The first important step forward was in 1971, when president Sadat of Egypt offered a full peace treaty to Israel in return for Israeli withdrawal from the Occupied Territories. That would have ended the international conflict. Israel rejected the offer, choosing expansion over security. In this case, expansion into the Egyptian Sinai, where General Sharon's forces had driven thousands of farmers into the desert to clear the land for the all-Jewish city of Yamit. The U.S. backed Israel's stand.\n\nThose decisions led to the 1973 war, a near disaster for Israel. The U.S. and Israel then recognized that Egypt could not be dismissed and finally accepted Sadat's 1971 offer at Camp David in 1979. But by then, the agreement included the demand for a Palestinian state, which had reached the international agenda.\n\nIn 1976, the major Arab states introduced a resolution to the U.N. Security Council calling for a peace settlement on the international border, based on U.N. 242, but now adding a Palestinian state in the Occupied Territories. That's Syria, Egypt, Jordan and every other relevant state. The U.S. vetoed the resolution again in 1980. The General Assembly passed similar resolutions year after year with the United States and Israel opposed.\n\nThe matter reached a head in 1988, when the PLO moved from tacit approval to formal acceptance of the two-state consensus. Israel responded with a declaration that there can be no, as they put it, \"additional Palestinian state between Jordan and the sea,\" Jordan already being a Palestinian state -- that's Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Shamir -- and also that the status of the territories must be settled according to Israeli guidelines. The U.S. endorsed Israel's stand. I can only add what I wrote at the time: \"It's as if someone were to argue the Jews don't need a second homeland in Israel, because they already have New York.\"\n\nIn May 1997, for the first time, Peres's Labour Party agreed not to rule out the establishment of a Palestinian state with limited sovereignty in areas excluding major Jewish settlement blocks, that is, the three cantons that were being constructed with U.S. support. The highest rate of post-Oslo settlement was in 2000, the final year of Clinton's term and Prime Minister Barak's.\n\nMaps of the U.S.-Israel proposals at Camp David show a salient, east of Jerusalem, bisecting the West Bank, and a northern salient virtually dividing the northern from the central canton. I have the maps if you want them. The current map considerably extends these salients and the isolation of East Jerusalem. My maps are from the leading Israeli scholars, Ron Pundak, the Director of the Shimon Peres Center. The crucial issue at Camp David was territorial, not the refugee issue, for which Arafat agreed to a pragmatic solution, as Pundak, the leading scholar, reveals. No Palestinian could accept the cantonization, including the U.S. favorite, Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nClinton -- we don't have to debate it, because Clinton recognized that Palestinian objections had validity, and in December 2000 proposed his parameters, which went some way toward satisfying Palestinian rights. In Clinton's words, \"Barak and Arafat had both accepted these parameters as the basis for further efforts. Both have expressed some reservations.\"\n\nThe reservations were addressed at a high level meeting in Taba, which made considerable progress and might have led to a settlement, but Israel called them off. That one week at Taba is the only break in 30 years of U.S.-Israeli rejectionism. High-level informal negotiations continued, leading to the Geneva Accord of December of 2002, welcomed by virtually the entire world, rejected by Israel, dismissed by Washington. That could have been the basis for a just peace. It still can. By then, however, Bush-Sharon bulldozers were demolishing any basis for it.\n\nEvery sane Israeli hawk understood that it was absurd for Israel to leave 8,000 settlers in Gaza, protected by a large part of the army, while taking over scarce water resources and arable land. The same conclusion was to withdraw from Gaza while expanding through the West Bank, and that will continue as long as Washington insists on marching on the road to catastrophe by rejecting minimal Palestinian rights. I'm quoting the warning of the four former heads of Israel's Shin Bet Security Service. \"There are clear alternatives, and if that march to catastrophe continues, we will have only ourselves to blame.\"\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Thank you, Professor Chomsky. In the spirit of discussion of this forum, we are now going to open the floor to your questions. So there are four microphones, one here, one-got it--there, one here in the intermediate stage, and one on the floor directly in front of me. We're going to proceed as follows, and so I want you to listen carefully to respect the civility of the discourse that I intend to make sure that we follow here. I'm going to ask you to introduce yourself, and to ask just one question, as the dean of our school always reminds people, 'questions end with a question mark'. And out of respect for all of our colleagues and students here this evening waiting patiently at the mics, I will insist on only one brief question. I would also ask that you, where appropriate, direct your question to one of the panelists. After that panelist responds I will invite his colleague for a brief comment and then we will return to the floor. So that you know what's coming I will begin over here, go up, across, and then back down.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi, my name is Michi Harmon, I'm from Jerusalem and this is a question for Professor Chomsky. I wanted to know if you think that it actually is relevant to dwell upon forming a shared narrative of both sides in going forth towards any solution of peace between us. Is it important for us to actually agree [on] what '48 represents for one side and what '48 represents for the other in order to live together in peace in the future?\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Yes, I think it's very relevant to understand history if you want to understand the present.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Professor Dershowitz, a comment.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: I agree and I think that the history has to be objectively verifiable, and it doesn't become true because Professor Chomsky says it's true. There was a two-state solution proposed by the United Nations in 1948, and if the Palestinians had accepted what the Israelis accepted, a small non-contiguous state with \"Bantustans\", to quote Professor Chomsky, and instead had not invaded, and if the Egyptians had not occupied the Gaza, something that nobody complained about-it was literally a prison for 20 years-and if the Jordanians hadn't occupied the West Bank-literally a prison for 20 years, and had the situation gone forward as it was supposed to go forward in '48, we would not be here. We would have a two-state solution. But, what happened is, it's clear that the Palestinian and Arab leadership was more interested in destroying the nascent, Jewish state of Israel than in establishing a Palestinian state. That is simply the truth, and there is no way to deny that. And no amount of rhetoric can undercut that reality.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: You'll notice that he starts with 1948 and I'd be glad to discuss that if you like but it's not relevant.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Ok.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: I began with 1967 for a good reason. Because it's in 1967 that U.N. 242 was passed and a framework was laid for peace settlements and since then it's the way I described.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Thank you if we can just\u2026\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Well, let me briefly respond only because I was\u2026\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Whoa,whoa.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: I participated in the drafting in a small way of 242. I was Arthur Goldberg's assistant at the Supreme Court. He drafted 242. He conferred with me and consulted with me. Two-four-two clearly contemplated Israel retaining some of the territories needed to create secure boundaries in 1967. The UN rejected a formulation of Israel returning all the territories, or \"the\" territories, and kept only \"territories\", and as the result of that Israel accepted 242, and at Khartoum, all the Arab states and the Palestinians unanimously rejected 242 and issued their three 'no's: no compromises, no recognition, no peace.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: If we can just\u2026\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: The truth of the matter is\u2026\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: If we can just, uh\u2026\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: \u2026easily discovered\u2026\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: If we can just hold there\u2026\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: \u2026from the foreign relations of the United States which points out that Arthur Goldberg\u2026\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: \u2026Professor Chomsky.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: \u2026approached the Jordanians and the others and got them to agree to accept--a qualified acceptance of 242 on the condition that there would be minor and mutual adjustments with no substantial change to the map. There were curved lines and it was agreed that they should be straightened.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: All right, what you can't see behind the podium is that both of my colleagues are armed with several dozen maps and that could get\u2026that could get dangerous in this part of the conversation so I'm gonna ask for some restraint so we make sure that we go directly to our participants. Yes, sir.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Thank you. Ken Sweder. I'd like to bring it to the present, and I'd like to ask Professor Dershowitz since this was a major point made by Professor Chomsky, whether or not you believe Israel is ready to negotiate for a contiguous state, not one of three separate Bantustans.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Yes. Now, contiguous depends of course on whether it means contiguous within the West Bank, or contiguous, including a connection between the West Bank and the Gaza. Now, it was the UN that created the lack of contiguity between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. In fact, the original proposals for Israel required complete non-contiguity. The North was separated from Tel Aviv, Tel Aviv from Jerusalem, yet Israel accepted a noncontiguous state. Under the Clinton parameters there would be complete contiguity with a circumvential (sic) highway around Jerusalem, much like route 128. It would take nine extra minutes to get from Ramallah to Bethlehem, than in the middle of the night through Jerusalem, because the shortest distance between two lines, taking into account traffic, is not a straight line. Now, there are all kinds of creative proposals for functional contiguity between the West Bank and Gaza, including a high tech rail line recently designed by the Rand Foundation. I have a picture of that in my book. It also looks much like the Danish railroad\u2026a high tech waterway\u2026all kinds of ways of connecting all the Palestinian cities to each other. Under this proposal no point in Palestine would be more than 90 minutes away from any other point in Palestine, including Gaza. It would take 34 minutes to get from Hebron to Gaza City on the rail line. That is functional contiguity. And the fact that the leader of the Labour party for years, has quit his party to join a new party, and the leader of Likud has quit his party, both in the interest of making peace, persuades me-plus an hour I had alone in Israel not so long ago with Prime Minister Sharon, and much time that I've spent with former Prime Minister Peres-that the will toward peace is absolute and genuine. Having said that, I also believe the will to peace by Abbas, and many of the leaders of the Palestinian Authority, is genuine too. Thank God Israel has to make peace with the Palestinians, and not with the professors.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Ok. A comment from\u2026\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Only a brief question. For those of you\u2026\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: \u2026briefly from Professor Chomsky.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: For those of you who want to see the maps that lie behind Meron Benvenisti's and Sara Roy's and Human Rights Watch and the European Union and other comments I have them here. But there's a very simple test that we can try. If that's a valid approach to contiguity for the Palestinian state in 22% of the former Palestine, let's propose it for the Israeli state\u2026\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: It was\u2026\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: \u2026in 78% of the former Palestine. Let's ask who would dream of proposing that.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: It was proposed. The Peel Commission proposed exactly that\u2026\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Sorry. Now. Now.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: \u2026and Israel accepted it.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Yeah, in 1937. But in a relevant period\u2026\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Look you know, when, when\u2026\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: We're talking about today.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: \u2026when thousands\u2026\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Today\u2026\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Gentlemen, gentlemen\u2026\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: \u2026who would propose that for Israel?\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: When thousands of people have been killed by terrorism you don't expect a country to go back to a proposal that was offered and rejected many, many years earlier. Options change when rejectionism sets in.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Ok, let's go to our next questioner.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: (unintelligible, off mic shouting)\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Coming back to 2005, you mention the connection between\u2026I'm sorry, Professor Dershowitz, my name is Theros Armon (sp?) by the way. You mention the connection between Gaza and West Bank\u2026\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Right.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: \u2026but I think to follow up on my colleague, I'm not sure if this is what he meant, what about the pieces of West Bank we're gonna end up with?\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Ok.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Settlements are continuing to be built inside the West Bank, the wall is being built inside the borders of 1967. So now please talk to me about peace, about pro-Palestine when it comes to building walls and actually separating the West Bank from east Jerusalem.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Ok, here is what a Palestinian state would have looked like had Camp David and Taba been accepted. It would be a completely contiguous West Bank with an area that--including Ma'ale Adumim and some of the other areas right side of Jerusalem--which would become part of Israel and would remain within the wall. The ultimate goal is to have a separation fence that is on the border, the accepted border. And I'll tell you what I think the real options are today. The real options are: if this new peace party wins, if the Sharon-Peres peace party wins, it will offer the Palestinians a very good deal, a deal much like that what was rejected at Camp David and Taba, and by the way, if you think it was the Israelis who rejected it, just ask Bill Clinton. He has told me, Dennis Ross has told me, it was completely in the fault, completely in the hands of Arafat, and that's true of Prince Bandar as well. But if it gets accepted this time, and if the peace party prevails again, they will be offered something very, very close to that. It will be a viable Palestinian state, much more viable than anything Israel was offered and accepted in '38 and in '47, and I think every reasonable person today would urge the Palestinians not to repeat the disastrous mistakes they made in '48, they made in '67, they made in 2000, they made in 2001. This time say, 'yes', accept the Palestinian state, build it, create an economy, create a political system, and finally peace can be achieved.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Thank you, Professor Chomsky.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: For those who you would like to see the map, I have it. It's as I said, from Ron Pundak, the leading Israeli scholar, the head of the Shimon Peres Peace Center. It shows-this is the Camp David map, which Clinton recognized was impossible, which is why they went on to Taba. And it cuts through the West Bank completely. (Referring to Alan Dershowitz's map) It's not that. It's\u2026\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: It is this.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Here it is. Here it is. This is Ron Pundak's map.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Ok. Ok.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: That's\u2026that's the one the Palestinians\u2026\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: We know that everyone can see them clearly.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Ron Pundak is not a Palestinian. He's the head of the Shimon Peres Peace Center.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: This is Dennis Ross' map.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Yes, Dennis Ross was the US negotiator whose word is meaningless. Ron Pundak is\u2026Ron Pundak is the leading Israeli scholar, and if we want to go into why Ross' book is worthless I'll be happy to say it. It's obvious to any reader, it stops right be\u2026\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: You know, it's obvious to you, it's not obvious to other people.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Well, I'll tell you why. It stops\u2026notice that his book stops immediately before Taba. Why? Because Clinton's parameters, and what Clinton said about the acceptance of them by both sides, and the Taba negotiations, completely undermines Dennis Ross' book. So he therefore terminates it right before that, and can therefore make these absurd claims. But if you want to learn something about it, look at Israeli scholarship. It's much more serious.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Thank you.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Good evening. I'd like to thank both professors for speaking so eloquently tonight. My name is Josh Susquis, I'm a recent alum of Harvard College, and I'm really glad to be back. I have [unintelligible] question for Professor Chomsky. It seems to me that you left out, in your analysis, the element of violence, psychological and physical, against Israel, against Jews, and it seems to me also that the history that Professor Dershowitz described, a lot of that is dictated by what happened, the terrorism, the wars against Jews, especially considering the immediate history right before the establishment of the state of Israel, the Holocaust and everything that has happened since. So I would like you to address the effect of -- the psychological effect and the physical effect of war and terrorism on Israel.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Yeah. That's half of a very important question. The other half of it is: What's the effect of war and terrorism on the Palestinians?\n\nNow, if you take a look at -- We're not supposed to talk about that question here, but if you look at them both, you will find that what Benny Morris described is, in fact, correct. The balance of terror and violence is overwhelmingly against the Palestinians, not surprisingly, given the balance of forces, and that's even true -- that's true right to the present. I mean, for -- you know, for decades, Israel was able to run the West Bank virtually with no forces, as Morris and others point out, because the population was so passive, while they were being humiliated, beaten, tortured, land stolen and so on, just as I quoted.\n\nFinally, there was a reaction, and it's interesting to see the U.S. reaction to it. In the first month of the Intifada -- this one, October 2000 -- in the first month of the Intifada, seventy-four Palestinians were killed, four Israelis were killed. It's all in the Occupied Territories. The Israeli army, according to its own records, fired a million bullets in the first day, which disgusted the generals when they learned about it.\n\nIsrael, in the first few days of the Intifada, was using U.S. helicopters - they don't make them - U.S. helicopters to attack civilian complexes, apartment houses and so on, killing and wounding dozens of people. And the U.S. did respond to that. Clinton responded by sending the biggest shipment of military helicopters in a decade to Israel. The press responded, too, by not publishing it, I should add, refusing to publish it, because it was repeatedly brought to their attention. Well, while the ratio was 20 to 1, which is pretty much what it's been for a long time, there was no concern here. Then, over the next two, three years, the ratio reduced to closer to 3 to 1, and then came enormous concern. About the one, not the three. And this goes back for a long time. What I quoted from Morris is accurate.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: No follow-ups; a very brief response.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Well, you know, the idea that there is this vast conspiracy between the American media and both Democrats like Clinton and Republicans like Bush, to hide the truth from the American public just does not bear reality. Israel is an open society. Any newspaper can come and cover it. Why would not the newspapers cover these stories? For one reason, they are figments of Chomsky's imagination and they just never happened.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: For those of you\u2026\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Now, I want to talk about another figment of his imagination. Chomsky constantly quotes\u2026\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Those that want to verify them\u2026\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: \u2026constantly quotes Benny Morris, as if Benny Morris supports his position. What happened is: Benny Morris was asked whether or not I accurately quote him in my book, The Case For Peace, and Benny Morris responded as follows: he still holds the views that I attributed to him, that I am right about his views, and that someone could read Morris's books -- this is a quote from Morris -- \"and arrive at exactly the same conclusions.\"\n\nAnd yet, Professor Chomsky, by selectively quoting and by picking tidbits out of context, knowing that you're not going to check up on him, tells you essentially that what you believe in the American media, whether it be the Washington Post, the Boston Globe, or the New York Times, is not true. In order to get the true meaning of the world, you have to move to Planet Chomsky, where the news reflects his perspective on reality. Well, I urge you to move to the real world. Read the real news. Don't read the selective Israeli journalists that he talks about. Listen to Dennis Ross. Dennis Ross actually helped to draw the maps.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Professor Dershowitz\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: He was there when I -\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Okay --\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: I have to finish. I haven't done my two minutes. When he said -- when I asked Dennis Ross at lunch today --\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Okay. It's a long two minutes.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: -- about these maps and what apparently Chomsky would say in response, Ross said, \"Ask Professor Chomsky one thing: Were you there?\" Dennis Ross was there. He knows what maps were presented to the Palestinians and what they rejected.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Thank you. If we could just go --\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: The head of the Shimon Peres Peace Center, Ron Pundak, who is the leading scholar on this and doesn't cut it off right before --\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Whoever you quote is the leading scholar. How do we know that?\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: -- right before he is refuted, the way Dennis Ross did, presents - he was involved in negotiations since before Oslo, right through Camp David up to the present, got a long historical account of it. You can read it, if you can read Hebrew; some of it's in English. The one -- all this smoke that was blown had to do with one fact that I mentioned, one, and you can check it, and please do.\n\nIn the first month of the Intifada -- I'm now using Israeli sources -- seventy-four Palestinians were killed, four Jews in the Occupied Territories. The first few days, this is reported in the press here, Boston Globe, Israel was using U.S. helicopters to attack apartment complexes. Clinton reacted with the biggest deal in a decade -- check it out. It's in the public record, not questioned by anyone -- to send military helicopters to Israel. There has been a database search of the U.S. -- it was reported in Europe. It was reported by Amnesty International. It's reported in Jane's Defence Weekly, the main military magazine in the world. There was a database search of the U.S. press, and they found nothing. I know of explicit cases, and I will be glad to tell them to you, where the press was approached and asked just to report the facts.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Why didn't they? Chomsky, why didn't they report it? Are they bad reporters? What's their motive? Explain why the Times or the Post wouldn't report this great story from Planet Chomsky?\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Gentlemen, if I could, as --\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: It's from Jane's Defence Weekly, from the international press, and so on. Yeah. They wouldn't -- you have to ask them why they didn't report it. I'll give you my opinion. In fact, I've written about it.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Let's hear it.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Given that the JFK Forum is here for the purpose of creating educated citizens and participants in a very important debate, I would ask each of you to exercise a bit of restraint so that we can have more of our questions from the audience. Please, and identify yourself.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Nancy Murray, and if you want the answer why didn't they report it, see Peace, Propaganda and the Promised Land. Now, my question, getting back to today, and your functional contiguity, I would like to know, have you seen not just the wall, but the eight terminals that are being built?\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Yes.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Under your vision, under your compromise, will the terminals be dismantled, will the wall be dismantled, will Jerusalem, East Jerusalem be under the sovereignty of Palestinians, not just under their control, and will the Palestinians have their water resources back, will they have freedom of movement? I mean, is this the kind of vision you have?\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Yes.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Is it a genuine one, or are you talking about Sharon's plan for a so-called Palestinian state?\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Well, I can only tell you what my proposal is, and I think it's a proposal that is today widely supported within Israel, that is, that the ultimate security fence -- I have been through not only the terminals, but the most recent high-tech terminal that was just built. I proposed, actually, that the security fence be placed on wheels and constantly be able to be moved consistent with Israeli security needs.\n\nThe Israeli Supreme Court ruled last year, and Chomsky misstated it, no Israeli Justice has ever said, and I challenge you to find a statement that Barak has ever said that Israeli law trumps international law. That is simply not true. What he said is that Israeli law enforces international law, but international law is not determined by a body, the International Court of Justice, which excludes Israelis from serving on it, and which will not allow an Israeli ever to be a member of that court. It would be as if a Southern black in the 1930s accepted, as the correct statement of American constitutional law, a decision by an all-white court in a case involving a black and a white man.\n\nNo, Israel accepts international law, enforces international law, and the goal, of course, of my peace proposal is that the security fence will eventually be dismantled when terrorism ends, but before that, it would be on the border, the way the Gaza fence is now on the border, and that water rights would be respected. There would be complete and total freedom of movement within the contiguous West Bank and between the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nEven today, Israel has given up control over the Rafah crossing. It now has a video, which it can watch to see as Palestinians, monitor exit and entry through the Rafah gateway. That's going to be the future. And if there is a will to peace, if there is a desire to make sure that there are two states, not simply one state, a Palestinian state, then all of these issues can be resolved and will be resolved. Israel has shown the will to resolve these issues. Certainly, I support a resolution that gives dignity, gives economic viability, gives political freedom and freedom of movement to the Palestinian people. Yes.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: And sovereignty over East Jerusalem?\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: And sovereignty over East Jerusalem.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Professor Chomsky.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Let me quote, once again -- I purposely quoted Justice Buergenthal, because I know of Mr. Dershowitz's opposition to the World Court. I therefore quoted the U.S. Justice, not the World Court, who stated that the segments of the wall being built to protect the settlements are ipso facto in violation of international humanitarian law. That's 80% of the wall. Two months later, Israel's high court stated, in contrast, that the separation wall must take into account the need to provide security for Israelis living in the West Bank, including their property rights. That's in direct contradiction to Justice Buergenthal's separate declaration, unanimously by the World Court.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: That's right.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: And if you would like his comment about how international law -- Israeli law supersedes international law in East Jerusalem because\u2026\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: That's not what you said.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: \u2026it was annexed to Israel illegally, I'll be happy to provide it to you. Just send me an email.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: But that's not what you said.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Please hold, let's go to the next\u2026\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Michael Seviem, I'm a second year student at the law school. Professor Chomsky, it seems like you've done a lot of remembering and very little imagining, and Alan Dershowitz's ideas, if they seem funny to have a train or some type of other high tech connection, at least they're creative and at least they're moving us forward. How do you deal with the issues of refugees? How would you connect Gaza and the West Bank? Or is the only solution, in your mind, a one state solution? What would you do about Jerusalem?\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Well, as you would know if you looked at anything I've written, instead of\u2026if you would know, if you look at anything that's written I've been supporting a two state settlement since the early 1970's, in print, and perhaps you can show me some of Mr. Dershowitz's material in print supporting it. I haven't found it. But yes, that's my position since the early 70's, all in print. As for connections, the issue, recall, at Camp David and at Taba and today, is territorial in the West Bank. Okay? And the current proposals are exactly as I described. Go through the sources I mentioned or find any other ones that you think are serious. Those are the major Israeli and western academic sources, and human rights organizations and so on. Yes, they break up the West Bank into three bantustans as Benvenisti said, with virtually no organic connection to East Jerusalem, which is the center of Palestinian life. That's why the E.U.--the European Union and Human Rights Watch and others flatly reject them. Now, it is possible-what Israel is in fact doing now, is developing a huge infrastructure system in the West Bank, with highways for Israelis, and paths for Palestinians, so that they don't have to interact with one another, which means that this network around the West Bank, which will be annexed to Israel roughly 40-50%. People can travel in it in great comfort from the suburbs around Tel Aviv including all the water resources, including most arable land. They can get to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. The Palestinians will be following paths. Actually I can read to you if you like how Israeli journalists are describing that, and if you'd like to check it out for yourself, I'd suggest sometime that you take what's officially called the Palestinian Road from Bethlehem to Ramallah, which takes like 10 minutes on the Jewish highway. I've taken it. It's a little winding road, a dirt road that goes right next to a wadi. If it's not raining you're lucky if you don't fall into it. And off in the hill you can see the paths where people are sort of moving. On the days when the settlers are not traveling, the roads are empty cause there's no way to get anywhere. I mean, you go in a broken down taxi cab up to a barrier and then you transport someone who needs dialysis, say, or a pregnant woman, carry them over a ditch and then as you go to another cab and so on. Yeah, that's a kind of contiguity. And again I say the same thing: if that's reasonable, then fine. Let's impose that kind of contiguity on Israel.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Hold, please. We have a very brief response.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Let me respond. First of all, listen to the words. There's an element of racism in one of the phrases we've heard today in describing this as a \"Jewish highway\". One point two million Israelis are Arabs. Many of them are Christians. There is no such thing as a Jewish highway in Israel. There are Muslim highways in Saudi Arabia. There are Muslim-only roads in other parts of the world, but there is no road-there is nothing in Israel that is opened only to Jews, even synagogues. Everything is open to Israeli Arabs, every road is opened to an Israeli Arab. When the peace solution is finally proposed, had the Camp David and Taba accords been accepted, the Palestinians would be free to build any superhighways they choose. And indeed, Israel has offered now a superhighway and a super-roadway between Gaza and Jerusalem-I'm sorry, between Gaza and Hebron. And the idea of-it's very difficult, I acknowledge, how to connect East Jerusalem to Bethlehem to Ramallah and to Jericho will require a challenge, but people are working on it. There are creative solutions being proposed. I am waiting, along with the student who asked the question, for some creative, positive, imaginary, imaginative solutions from Professor Chomsky. All we're hearing is a recitation of the past and a pessimistic notion of \"as long as the American evil empire and Israel are involved, there will be no peace.\"\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Thanks. Let's go to the next\u2026\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Well, I congratulate Mr. Dershowitz again for one true statement. They are not Jewish roads. They are Israeli roads. That is, they are roads of the sovereign-well, I'm quoting the High Court-the sovereign state of the Jewish people in Israel and the diaspora. And that's correct.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Thank you. OK.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Oh, that's like saying that British roads are roads of the sovereign Anglican people.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Fine, and that's\u2026\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: I mean, Britain is an Anglican country as well.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: OK. If we can have your question, please.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: I agree to your qualification. They're Israeli roads.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: We can\u2026gentlemen\u2026\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: They're Israeli highways and Palestinian paths. If you want to create a solution, I mentioned one.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Let's go to the questioner.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY I mentioned it. The Geneva Accords. The Taba agreements, which Israel canceled.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: I accept\u2026\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Those are creative solutions.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: I accept the Taba agreements\u2026\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Professor Dershowitz\u2026\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: \u2026and I think that many Israelis do as well.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: We're gonna focus on this next question.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Then you should explain to Mr. [unintelligible] why they objected to them.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Please. We're gonna focus on this next question.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Hello?\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: You are?\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes. Hi. My name is Abraham Reeseman. I'm a Sophomore at the college. This is really a question for both of you but I guess I'll ask Professor Chomsky just cause Professor Dershowitz just spoke. It's sort of funny that we're all here given that a lot of us have never been to Israel, never been to Palestine, and it's long been one of the sort of strange paradoxes in world politics that Americans and people the world over can get so enraged about either side when it's a conflict that many of us will never firsthand experience. Specifically, how would both of you like to see young people like me and a lot of us here, envisioning the conflict in the future, because a lot of us have a tendency to internalize it to a degree where it's not about people anymore-on both sides. There are people I know who are ardent Zionists, who never go to Israel, who believe in it because they are very religiously Jewish, and all of a sudden it becomes detached from the realities on the ground and there are people who are very pro-Palestinian who are strongly in favor of social justice and economic justice.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: OK. Thank you.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: I'm sorry. Yeah, how do you..?\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Professor Chomsky.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Well, my feeling is you should approach it as an American. And as for an American, it is one of the lead issues in the world. Israel is able to do these things, to dismantle and destroy the West Bank, to disintegrate the community, because the United States gives it massive aid, unparalleled in international affairs, not only military and economic, but also diplomatic by, as I mentioned, for the last 30 years, unilaterally blocking the two-state settlement, which Israel also totally rejected, alone, the two of them, and as long as you, the American taxpayer, goes on supporting this, yes, it will continue, and it'll lead to exactly what the Bantustan-style solution that Benvenisti and others describe, right on the ground and, yes, so therefore, it's of enormous importance to Americans.\n\nAs for solutions, pretty straightforward. They were coming close to a solution at Taba until Israel called it off. Negotiations continued, leading to several proposals of which the most detailed were the Geneva Accords. You can find out what I thought about all of those in print. You can ask Mr. Dershowitz where he supported them in print. The Geneva Accords in December 2002 were accepted by essentially the whole world. Israel rejected them. The U.S. refused even to send a message to the Geneva meetings. But they're still potentially alive, and American citizens can compel our own government to reverse its program, to accept the international consensus for the first time, and then we'll be on the way to a solution.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Thank you. Briefly, Professor Dershowitz.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: I, too, have written about the Geneva Accords in chapter six of my book, and I generally support many elements of the Geneva Accords. I do not support the right of return, that is, the idea that 700,000 or now 4 million Palestinians can demographically destroy Israel.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Which is rejected in the Geneva Accords.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: It is not rejected in the Geneva Accords. It is not accepted or rejected. It is left for future negotiations.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: It is left open, because the Palestinians already --\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Now, see how you change your view. First it's accepted, then it's left open. What is your next position?\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Fine. Let's be precise. They did not say anything about that, because the Palestinians had already at Camp David and at Taba accepted the so-called pragmatic settlement, which would not affect the demographic character of Israel.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: That is simply false.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: If you want to learn about that, read the serious scholarship, like Ron Pundak, head of the Shimon Perez Peace --\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: That is simply false. I can tell you that President Clinton told me directly and personally that what caused the failure of the Camp David-Taba accords was the refusal of the Palestinians and Arafat to give up the right of return. That was the sticking point. It wasn't Jerusalem. It wasn't borders. It was the right of return. Now if you believe --\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Can we move on from there?\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: If you believe that the United States has unilaterally rejected the two-state solution -- that's what we heard from Professor Chomsky -- that it's the United States that has rejected the two-state solution, when every modern American president has favored the two-state solution, I say, welcome to Planet Chomsky.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: OK, if we can hold there\u2026\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Now, here's a simple exercise. You can believe one of two things: the extensive published diplomatic record, which I gave you a sample of and you can find in detail in books of mine and others, or what Mr. Dershowitz says he heard from somebody. Which you can't check.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: No, or -- and check the diplomatic record.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: OK. Professor Dershowitz, hold.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Check the maps.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Sir, your question.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: And read Dennis Ross' book, which contains appendices which have the diplomatic record.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: OK.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: What Chomsky is telling you to do, is read the available record in Esperanto. He constantly tells you to read sources he knows you can't read, because he knows if you check\u2026\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: OK.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: \u2026his sources, they are false.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: OK, let's go to the next question.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: How many of you are capable of reading\u2026\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: They are simply false.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: How many of you are capable of reading English?\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: He makes it up as he goes along. That's the reality.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: OK. Thank you.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: How many of you are capable of reading English? Including\u2026\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: And if he says you\u2026you don't find it in the press, his answer is, \"It's not in the press, it's part of a conspiracy to keep it out of the press\". He can't lose.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Thanks very much. Hey can you guys hold for a sec?\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: It's in the documentary record. It's in the documentary record. Which happens to be quite different from the press\u2026\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: You can say that.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: \u2026not only on this issue.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: You can say it. But you know, you can cry wolf so many times.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: OK. It's important\u2026gentlemen\u2026I think it's important that we take advantage of your expertise, your many years of wisdom by hearing a couple more questions. Please. You are?\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi. My name is Todd Silverstein. And I was campaign manager on NATO and special advisor to Prime Minister Barak in Camp David. So I think I know, at least know less than Ron Pundak my friend about what happened in Camp David and in Taba. I am saying it only because I think that what Professor Chomsky said here, a lot of things are inaccurate, even though\u2026\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Do you have a question?\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Yes. Even though\u2026\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Please give it.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: I think, just before the question, because it's very important\u2026\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Please go directly to your question.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: The\u2026the\u2026(pause)\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: You know there was a question before that had about a seven minute prerequisite. This is an expert who was there, who was an eyewitness. I think he should be permitted to precede his question with a one minute point.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: I don't want to go into history and I'm a little excited because you have to understand one thing. I believe we have only one last opportunity to reach peace and this is this coming party and this coming election. Now, my question to you, Professor Chomsky-and I agree with you Israel has done a lot of crazy and terrible things to Palestinians, the Palestinians have done a lot of crazy and terrible things to Israelis, but, let's say that this new party, after the election, guided by Sharon, is to offer the Palestinians a deal-doesn't matter which deal-a deal that will be accepted by most Palestinians, would you support this deal even if it doesn't reflect your views or your ideological views?\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Well, I'm glad to see that you-I assume that you endorse Ron Pundak's expert knowledge. Correct? I therefore recommend to all of you who read English that you read the summary of his review of all of this in the Journal of the Institute of Strategic and Security Studies in England, and for those of you who read Hebrew, like you, I presume, you read the much longer study that Ron Pundak and Shaul Arieli wrote--it's on the Ha'aretz Center website--which describes in detail, if you like I can quote it for you. As to what I would accept\u2026\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Ron Pundak was not in Camp David, by the way.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Pardon?\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Ron Pundak was not in Camp David.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: He was one of the negotiators in the background\u2026\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: He was not.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: He was one of the negotiators in the background, and he was from\u2026\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: He was not.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: \u2026He was from Oslo, and his study\u2026\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: He's from Oslo. He was never. He was not even close to Camp David, just for the record.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: His study, he was one of the advisors, as you know\u2026\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Chomsky says so, it must be true.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Read it--you're the one who told me you agree with him. If you think not, tell the Shimon Peres center to fire his director. Those are the basic Israeli documents. Furthermore, they're supported by plenty of others. If you want to know more about Taba, you can read the European Union report, accepted by both sides, which says exactly what I said. As to your question, yes, I already told you the answer. There is a very good solution on the table. It's the solution that they came close to in Taba before Israel canceled it, and that was then carried forward by high level Israeli and Palestinian negotiators informally, leading to the Geneva\u2026that's what I'm telling you.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Quiet, please.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Leading to the December 2002 Geneva Accords, which are right there. You can read them in English, you can read them in Hebrew, they're on the web, no problem, look up the [unintelligible] shalom website. That's a pretty good solution. It's not perfect.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: I didn't get an answer, sorry.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: That's the answer to your question. Yes.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: No, the answer was, even if it wasn't your plan\u2026\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Pardon?\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: \u2026and most Palestinians\u2026\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Pardon?\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: Even if it wasn't the plan that you think is optimal, or I\u2026\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: What are you asking?\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: \u2026and most Palestinians, because I know most Israelis probably would vote for it, if most Palestinians would vote for it, even if it's not optimal--and it's not gonna be optimal, let me tell you--if most Palestinians would vote for it, would you accept it as a [unintelligible]?\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: It's not up to me to accept. You asked what I thought.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: OK.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: What I thought is\u2026what I think is, there's a very simple, creative solution, which happens to be very close to the international consensus, that I've been supporting for over 30 years, and that the United States and Israel have been unilaterally blocking. It was reached by high level Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, and though there hasn't been a vote about it, my guess is that if there was a poll on both sides, the majority on both sides would probably accept it. But that's totally different from the proposals of the Sharon-Peres party, the Kadimah, or incidentally of Ha'artez's Labour party so far. So far he simply endorsed the expansionist program that breaks up the West Bank into cantons.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Perfect selective\u2026\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Thirty second response.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Perfect selective use of Shimon Peres. You know, the Shimon Peres Peace Center. I want to read you a quote from Noam Chomsky. He described Shimon Peres, he described Ronald Reagan at one point, as the semi-divine Reagan, as one of the iconic group of mass murderers from Hitler to Idi Amin to Peres. So, on one day of the week you find Noam Chomsky describing Peres, this great man of peace, as an iconic mass murderer, and on another day he's quoting the authority of Shimon Peres to make peace. I mean\u2026\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Excuse me.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: \u2026where do you stand on Shimon Peres? Is he a man of peace or is he an iconic mass murderer?\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: He is an iconic mass murderer, and I've given plenty of evidence for it, and he is not a man of peace. I did not refer to Shimon Peres. I referred to the director of the Shimon Peres Peace Center.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: So you\u2026\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: That's not Shimon Peres.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: But you stick to the argument that Shimon Peres, the man who just joined in to make peace is an iconic mass murderer\u2026\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: You want me to read\u2026\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: \u2026and not a man of peace. I think that says it all.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: OK.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: You want me to run through his record?\n\nBRIAN MANDELL No, I think we\u2026\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Including the fact that as late as 1996, he informed the press that a Palestinian state will never happen? And in 1997 he said, \"Maybe we can ultimately tolerate it somewhere, but we're not saying where\"? That's not a man of peace.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Thank you. You are?\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: My name is Amy Levinne, I'm a first year at the Kennedy School. My question is for Professor Dershowitz. You had said that one of the steps in your plan for peace in the future was for the Palestinians to stop their terrorism activities.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: That's right.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: So my question would be, if you were advising the Israeli government, is there anything about their current strategy and how they respond to these terrorism tactics that you would advise them to change to move forward?\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Yes. I would. I do not favor, for example, house destructions. On the other hand, I do think that targeted killings of \"ticking bomb\" terrorist leaders and terrorists has been quite effective. Hundreds, perhaps thousands of terrorist acts have been prevented, including an attempt to blow up a gas tank outside of Tel Aviv, including an attempt to blow up a port in Ashdod. Tens of thousands of Israelis probably would have been killed but for the intelligence activities and the preventive activities of the Israeli government. I have a book coming out in January called Preemption, where I set out all the parameters of where I think preemptive acts are justified, where I think they're not justified. I think Israel gets a C+ or a B- in its compliance with human rights in fighting terrorism, which is higher than any country ever has gotten, comparably facing any external threats, and I challenge, in fact, anybody in this room, or Professor Chomsky, to name me any other country which has faced comparable threats of terrorism--comparable external threats--which has ever had a supreme court and an academy which has been more sensitive to the human rights and civil rights of those who would destroy it. I say, C+ / B-. If I were an Israeli I would demand much more. I would demand that it get up to the B+ range, but surely, a much better standard than the United States has followed in Iraq, surely a much higher standard than Egypt or Jordan, surely a much higher standard than France, followed when faced with terrorist threats, and at least comparable and probably better than England when it was facing terrorist threats from Northern Ireland. So, when you make comparisons and you argue that Israel is the worst human rights violator in the world, which is the mantra on Planet Chomsky, one always has to look at comparable factors and comparable countries. It's not enough to single out Israel and say Israel isn't perfect. If in fact, you wanted to have divestiture, which Chomsky before he opposed it, favored it, if you wanted to have divestiture, I'd favor it if you listed all the countries in the world in terms of their compliance with human rights and did divestiture in order of their compliance, you would never even get to Israel on that list.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Professor Chomsky.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Well, if you would like to, here's an exercise for the reader. I won't waste your time on it. Write a letter to Alan Dershowitz, ask him to cite the source where I described Israel as the worst human rights violator in the world, or even anything remotely like it. If he had ever, if he would ever look at a word that's written, so he would know, for example, that I was supporting the two state settlement in the early 70's when he was saying nothing about it and hasn't until recently, he would also know that I described in detail how the US-Israeli record was considerably better than the US record. But to answer his challenge, there are certainly cases that are much better than Israel's record. Countries that have suffered far worse terrorism and have not done anything like\u2026\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: For example?\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Well, take an obvious case: Nicaragua. Uncontroversial case. Uncontroversial, because much as you hate the World Court, the World Court ruled that the United States was carrying out what it called \"unlawful use of force\" against Nicaragua. That's international terrorism in lay language. The case was run by one of your distinguished colleagues, and ordered the US to stop the terrorist acts and to pay massive reparations. The US rejected the court judgment, vetoed two security council resolutions supporting the court judgments, went on to practically destroy the country. The number of people killed in that terrorist attack, translating to per capita equivalents here, would be about 2.25 million. That's more than the total in all US wars ever. There were no targeted assassinations, and unlike Israel, Nicaragua didn't even close the newspapers. I mean, Israel has repeatedly closed newspapers-even in Israel, but mostly in the occupied territories-cause it claims that they have some connection with terrorists. The leading newspaper in Nicaragua right to the end was owned by a supporter of the US terrorist army and was openly on its front pages calling for the overthrow of the government. Occasionally they reduced some of its newsprint. They never closed it. That's one case, an obvious one.\n\nTake and even more obvious case: Cuba. The United States launched-since we're at the Kennedy Center, I can point out that John F. Kennedy launched a major terrorist attack against Cuba in 1961, right after the failure at the Bay of Pigs. It was a very serious terrorist war, plenty of documentation about it from the best sources you like, Arthur Schlesinger, Raymond Garthoff, all of you can read that. Major terrorist war, it's going on right to the present, based in Florida. Cuba has not carried out terrorist actions in the United States. So\u2026\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: So Cuba has a better human rights record than Israel on Planet Chomsky\u2026\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: No, on the issue of\u2026\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: \u2026but no where else in the world.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Sorry, on the issue of preemption, which is the one you raised. Yes, you raised a challenge about preemption, and I told you that there are many much better cases.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: No, I didn't say that. Let me be very clear\u2026\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: In fact, now, I'll give you\u2026\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Let me be very clear what I said\u2026\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: \u2026right now. Israel and the United States are both threatening Iran with destruction. Well, you know, preemption, according to Dershowitz, would require that Iran be carrying out targeted assassinations in Israel and the United States. That's outrageous.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: I think we need to hold there. We're gonna go-this is gonna be our last question of the evening here.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER: My name is Lori Chrisbuelik, I'm a second year MPP student. Thank you for this lively debate. I have a question kind of directed at both of you, but Professor Dershowitz, in your book, you said you hoped to have a win-win situation, where everyone had to give something up. And what's clear to me after this debate and just looking at history, that no one is able to come to a resolution where they're willing to give up enough to the other person. So, it seems to me that the only way to win is to have everybody lose. So I'd like you to comment on a proposal where maybe, if you all lost, we'd actually come out winning?\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: Well, I think there is a win-win possible situation. Israel has been giving up much. It gave up the Gaza. It, by the way, offered to give up the Gaza to Egypt way back in the early 1980s. Egypt wouldn't take it back. There was no international outcry over the occupation of the Gaza by Egypt for 20 years, nor was there any international -- and I'm sure there must be a long record. Check Chomsky's writing. He must have in print large opposition to the occupation of Gaza by Egypt and strong opposition to the occupation of the West Bank by Jordan. Funny, I never came across it in my research, but I'm sure it must be there, if you check at least the Czechoslovakian version of one of his writings, and -- so, I do think there's a win-win solution.\n\nThe win-win solution is the one I proposed, starting in 1967, and that is, Israel make territorial adjustments necessary to secure its boundary and securities, consistent with Palestinian rights, no occupation of Palestinian cities, a two-state solution. That is a win-win situation.\n\nAnd let me tell you why I consider myself pro-Palestinian. I am pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian, because I favor a viable, healthy, economically strong, politically democratic Palestinian state. That will be good for Palestine. It will be good for Israel. It will be good for the world.\n\nIsrael has a major stake in the success of Palestine, whereas the Palestinians have never had a major stake in the success of Israel. And so, I see a successful Palestinian state, a viable, largely contiguous Palestinian state as a win-win situation, not only for Israel and the Palestinians, but for the United States and the rest of the world. I only hope that Professor Chomsky can join me in agreeing that we're not going to get a perfect solution. And let's just advocate a solution that's acceptable.\n\nThe question that was asked before was to me the key question. If the Palestinians accept the solution that Professor Chomsky finds unacceptable, will he use his enormous resources as the most influential intellectual in the world today to turn the Palestinians against this peace proposal, or will he lend his great prestige to urging the Palestinians and his academic supporters all over the world to accept a pragmatic compromise solution. Professor Chomsky, a lot turns on you. You are a very important and influential person. And therefore, you would understand your power and use it in the interests of peace.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Okay. Just before I ask one of the most influential intellectuals today to respond to Lori's question, just to tell you where we're headed, Professor Chomsky will respond. Then, in accordance with our rule of the procedure and decorum for this evening, I will ask Professor Chomsky to offer a two-minute summary for the evening, to be followed by Professor Dershowitz. Professor Chomsky.\n\nNOAM CHOMSKY: Yes. Well, with regard to my opposition to the Jordanian-Egyptian occupation, there is ample material in print, and there has been for 35 years, ever since I publicly and openly and very prominently supported the two-state settlement, which Mr. Dershowitz says he now supports. I'm glad to hear that. I don't have the background evidence. Let's return -- and that means, of course, opposing Jordanian-Egyptian occupation.\n\nLet's turn to the question we were asked to address: Where do we go from here? Well, we actually have two fundamental choices. One choice is to support Washington's continued dedication to the road to catastrophe that's outlined by Israel's four former security chiefs, namely watching in silence as Washington funds the cantonization of the West Bank, the breaking of its organic links to Jerusalem, and the disintegration of the remnants of Palestinian society. That choice adopts the advice of Moshe Dayan to his cabinet colleagues in the early '70s. Dayan was in charge of the occupation. He advised them that we must tell the Palestinians, that we have no solution, you shall continue to live like dogs, and whoever wishes, may leave. That's the solution that is now being implemented. Don't take my word for it. Go check the sources I cited, very easy, all English.\n\nThere's an alternative. The alternative is to return to the spirit of the one break in U.S.-Israeli rejectionism. That is, the week in Taba in January 2001, before Israel called it off, and to take seriously the follow-up proposals from high-level negotiators on both sides, of which the Geneva Accords are the most detailed. There is overwhelming international support for taking them as the basis for a political settlement. It does come close to the long-standing international consensus that the United States and Israel have barred, and that I have personally been supporting for the last over 30 years. That's the road away from catastrophe, towards an end to violence and towards eventual reconciliation. Either choice is within our reach. From that point on, it's up to us.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Professor Dershowitz.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ: We do seem to have a remarkable point of agreement. I think we both do agree that the proposals made at Taba do provide a useful basis for a peace process. Now, Taba didn't end because Israel left. Taba ended because Arafat rejected Camp David, thereby causing the election of Sharon over Barak. There was no government, essentially, that could carry out the Taba proposals, which were favored by a very, very large number of Israelis. That's why Prince Bandar said to Arafat at Camp David and at Taba, 'If you reject the proposals at Camp David, you are going to get Sharon instead of Barak. You're never, ever going to get a better deal.'\n\nThankfully, he was wrong. Sharon emerged as a man of courage and a man of vision. And I, myself, although I never did support Sharon in the past, strongly support the efforts made by Sharon and Peres, a great, great man of peace, a man who has vision, a man who imagines the future, a man who can bring about peace in the world and peace in the Middle East. And I think the prospects for peace based on the Taba proposals are quite realistic. I think that if this party wins the election and invites the Palestinians to the table, and the Palestinians don't again miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity, there will be a real prospect for negotiation, a real prospect for peace based on pragmatism.\n\nOne final word about the sources. Please, the other area where Professor Chomsky and I agree, check his sources. Take him at his word. Go back tonight and Google and read the sources. Read them in English. Read them in whatever language you can, and then email us both as to what the sources show.\n\nAnd finally, in a constructive and positive way, I urge you: Imagine peace. Imagine the peace dividend that will come to the world if finally a pragmatic solution based on peace comes to the Palestinian people and the Israeli people. I'm hoping for shalom, for salaam, and for peace. Thank you.\n\nBRIAN MANDELL: Thank you. Just before we conclude, and I thank our speakers. I want to share with you in a very few seconds, what I have heard tonight, standing between these two scholars. The first\u2026the first is that in looking around this room, it is clear to me that being members of the international community to which we all belong, whether we have been to Israel or Palestine or to other conflict arenas or not, that people can care deeply about people in conflict, and understand that there needs to be a way through. Secondly, as we heard from some of our questioners, the parties themselves, Israelis and Palestinians, seem to be post-disengagement and in their two election processes quickly approaching a crossroads, perhaps a tipping point where some form of acceptable solution that will involve some part of loss of a dream to both sides will make pragmatism reign. The third thing, in which I've been honored to be a part of this discussion tonight, is that academe and the scholarly community matter in this discussion. I have read a great deal of the works of both Professors Chomsky and Dershowitz, and in both of these readings, whether you agree with points of view, challenge their sources is beside the point. What you have been treated to tonight is two individuals who have spent a lifetime thinking very, very hard about some of the most difficult problems in international public policy, and on behalf of this group here tonight, to my scholarly colleagues I am eternally grateful.
