shorter, nights are colder\nFeeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra\nThe world's hot, my son got knocked, evidently\nIt's elementary, they want us all gone eventually\nTrooping out of state for a plate of knowledge\nIf coke was cooked without the garbage\nWe'd all have the top dollars\nImagine everybody flashing, fashion, designer clothes\nLacing your clique up with diamond Roles\nYour people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers\nGo in raw, imagine law with no undercovers\nJust some thoughts for the mind\nI take a glimpse into time\nWatch the blimp read \"The World Is

stretches\nSo many years of depression make me vision\nThe better living, type of place to raise kids in\nOpen they eyes to the lies, history's told foul\nBut I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child\nSeeing things like I was controlling, clique rolling\nTricking six digits on kicks and still holding\nTrips to Paris, I'd civilize every savage\nGive me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish\nPolitical prisoners set free, stress free\nNo work release, purple M3's and jet skis\nFeel the wind breeze in West Indies\nI'd let Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities\nAnd reverse fiends to Willies\nIt sounds foul, but every girl I meet'd go down-town\nI'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa\n\n[Chorus: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)]\nIf I ruled the world (Imagine that)\nI'd free all my

around with me and turn me back to the old me\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nNowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say\nBut nothin' comes out when they move their lips\nJust a bunch of gibberish\nAnd motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre\nNowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say\nBut nothin' comes out when they move their lips\nJust a bunch of

bloodier way? (Yup)\nJust study a tape of N.W.A\nOne day I was walkin' by\nWith a Walkman on, when I caught a guy\nGave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)\nAnd strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani\nI don't give a fuck if it's dark or not\nI'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge\nWhen I'm drunk as fuck\nRight next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage\nHoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off\nFuck you too, bitch! Call the cops!\nI'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs\nAnd when the cops came through\nMe and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house\nWith a can full of gas and a hand full of matches\nAnd still weren't found out (Right here!)\nSo from here on out, it's the Chronic II\nStartin' today and tomorrow's anew\nAnd I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew\nChicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady\nHotter than a set of twin babies\nIn a Mercedes Benz with the windows up\nWhen the temp goes up to the mid-80s\nCallin' men ladies\nSorry Doc, but I been crazy\nThere's no way that you can save me\nIt's okay, go with him, Hailie (Dada?)\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nNowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say\nBut nothin' comes out when they move their lips\nJust a bunch of gibberish\nAnd motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre\nNowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say\nBut nothin' comes out when they move their lips\nJust a bunch of gibberish\nAnd motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre\n\n[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]\nIf it was up to me, you motherfuckers'd stop\nComin' up to me with your hands out\nLookin' up to me like you want somethin' free\nWhen my last CD was out, you weren't bumpin' me\nBut now that I got this little company\nEverybody wanna come to me\nLike it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me\n\u2018Cause I'm from the streets of C-Compton! (Compton!)\nI told 'em all\nAll 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?\nNow you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none\nWhat, you think I sold 'em all\n\u2018Cause I stay well off?\nNow all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off\nWhat, \u2018cause I been in the lab\nWith a pen and a pad tryin' to get this damn label off?\nI ain't havin' that\nThis is the millennium of Aftermath\nIt ain't gon' be nothin' after that\nSo give me one more platinum plaque\nAnd fuck rap, you can have it back\nSo where's all the Mad Rappers at?\nIt's like a jungle in this habitat\nBut all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats\nWhile you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nNowadays, everybody wanna talk\nLike they got somethin' to say\nBut nothin' comes out when they move their lips\nJust a bunch of gibberish\nAnd motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre\nNowadays, everybody wanna talk\nLike they got somethin' to say\nBut nothin' comes out when they move their lips\nJust a bunch of gibberish\nAnd motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre\n\n[Outro: Eminem]\nNowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say\nBut nothin' comes out when they move their lips\nJust a bunch of gibberish\nAnd motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre"}, {"Title": "All Eyez On Me", "Artist": "2Pac", "Lyrics": "[Intro: 2Pac]\nBig Syke, Newt, Hank, Beauregard, Big Sur (yeah)\nY'all know how this shit go (you know)\nAll eyes on me\nMotherfuckin' OG\nRoll up in the club and shit, is that right?\nAll eyes on me\nAll eyes on me\nBut you know what?\n\n[Verse 1: 2Pac]\nI bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust\nSo many player-hatin' niggas tryna sound like us\nSay they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin'\nStraight to the depths of Hell is where them cowards goin'\nWell, are you still down?

Deja vu again?\n\nKATSUYA: Now Mt. Iwato of Araya...What is Tatsuya trying to do?\n\nNATE: It appears that Suou's purpose is to make you realize...or\nremember something, Ms. Amano. Do you have any ideas?  I am interested,\nsince I've gotten involved in this.\n\nELLEN: Perhaps Tatsuya wants you to remember something, Ms. Amano? It\nappears to be that way...\n\nULALA: Did you hear what that old woman said?  Looks like something\nhappened here.\n\nOLD WOMAN: W-What just happened...?

Are you saying that Amano's visions are all\nmemories of a different reality...?\n\nKATSUYA: Are you saying that Ms. Amano and Tatsuya Sudou came from the\nsame reality as you!?\n\nTATSUYA: That's not entirely true...Sudou was truly a person of \"This\nSide\"...He was told by \"him\" of the existence of the \"Other Side\" and\nwas only being used...\n\nULALA: So what do you mean!? It's not like Ma-ya came from that world\neither, right?  Why does Ma-ya only have the memory of this \"Other\nSide\"? None of us have it!\n\nTATSUYA: There are many reasons...I don't think you should know any\nmore...\n\nKATSUYA: Idiot...! As if we can back out after all this!\n\nTATSUYA: If you continue, something bad may happen!\n\n*MAYA: Tatsuya...I have a right to know.*\n\nTATSUYA: Fine...A picture is worth a thousand words...\n\n(Tatsuya goes on ahead.

Forever, the five of us all\ntogether...we all believed that...But Maya had to leave town for family\nreasons...We couldn't bear that, so we locked Maya in the shrine...And\nthen Sudou set it aflame...We thought Maya had died, so we were\nscared...And each of us suppressed the memory...Jun remembered that and\nbecame a Joker. Controlled by \"him\", he tried to end the world in\nexchange for the ideal evolution.\n\n\nREALITY\n\nULALA: His story...It's just like what we're going through, don't you\nthink...?\n\nKATSUYA: Who is that \"him\" that controlled Jun...?\n\nTATSUYA: His appearence was that of Jun's father, but inside was\ncompletely different... Crawling Chaos...Nyarlathotep...He is the being\nthat stands opposite to Philemon...The shadow that lurks deep within\nman's heart, toying with destiny...\n\nTATUSYA: He wants to bring the same chaos to This Side as the Other\nSide. The New World Order is just one of his pawns.\n\nBAOFU: Hey, what do you mean...causing the same thing to happen?\n\nTATSUYA:......You'll find out.\n\n(He goes on ahead. Talk to your members.)\n\nULALA: There's a boss behind the New World Order...?  And that guy's in\neach and everyone of us!?\n\nBAOFU: The ideal-collecting Masquerade, and the Kegare-collecting New\nWorld Order, huh...Serizawa's right, the situations are similar...\n\nKATSUYA: The being that stands opposite to Philemon...? The archetype of\nexistential destruction...? If such a thing does exist, it is well\nbeyond our comprehension...The shadow of mankind...\n\nNATE: Nyarlathotep...!? It wasn't merely Guido's Persona?\n\nELLEN: Nyarlathotep...Crawling Chaos...The Faceless God...He is not just\na Persona?\n\n\nFINAL SPRING OF MIRRORS\n\nFLASHBACK: NYARLATHOTEP'S LAIR\n\n(This shows Tatsuya, Maya, Lisa, Eikichi, and Jun at Nyarlathotep's\nlair, which looks identical to Philemon's Lair.  Philemon and\nNyarlothotep appear.)\n\nPHILEMON: Going soft after playing the father?  Crawling\nChaos...Nyarlathotep.  Now you should understand what I said.\n\nNAYRLATHOTEP: Ha...It may be true these people can give us good results\nfor our research...\n\nGINKO: What are you saying, Philemon!?\n\nPHILEMON: We are the orgin of people's hearts...The Collective\nUnconsciousness is just one side of that coin...We've watched the\naffairs of man from here...I direct the strong of will, and he, the\nCrawling Chaos, drags the weak to Hell.  It is all in order to determine\nif people's hearts, which are in conflict, can arise as something\ncomplete...You all have displayed that possiblity.  If there are more\nhumans like you, humans can one day become a perfect existence...\n\nTATSUYA: Everything...This is all part of your experiment!?\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: You should show more respect to me. This one can only\nobserve.  However...I am different.\n\n(A woman that looks like Maya Okamura from Seven Sisters High School\nappears and stabs Maya with a spear. Maya then falls to the ground.)\n\nMAYA: .......?\n\nTATSUYA: Maya!!\n\n(Tatsuya and co. rush over to Maya's side and Lisa uses her Persona to\nheal Maya and Okamura teleports to Nyarlathotep's side.)\n\nEIKICHI: Dammit! Ginko! Use your powers!\n\nGINKO: I'm trying!! But...but...The blood won't stop!!  Why...Why won't\nmy spell work!? Philemon!?\n\nPHILEMON: Nyarlathotep...You spread the legend of the Sacred Spear, for\nthis...?\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Blood poured endlessly from the body of God's son when\npierced with that spear. It's the legend..or, \"rumor\" that you humans\nhave continued to tell for some 2000 years.  Quuite effective, isn't\nit?\n\nMAYA:.....\n\nMAYA:.......\n\nTATSUYA: \"Hurry up and forget about me?\"...Don't be ridiculous...!!! How\ncould I forget...!!?\n\nMAYA:.....\n\nTATSUYA: Yeah...I'll grab it...You taught me...I'll grab hold of my\ndream..so..\n\n(Maya dies)\n\nTATSUYA: ......Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Ha ha...Should people be able to realize their dreams?\nForsaking one of the same name, lost in illusion..This is this woman's\ndream.  I will make the human's dream of destruction come true!!\n\n\nREALITY\n\nTATSUYA: Do you remember now...?\n\n(Maya falls to the ground)\n\nMAYA: ...........\n\nKATSUYA: What happened...after that...?\n\nTATSUYA: Maya, with the name of Maya Okamura, died...The prophecy\nfullfilled...The whole world destroyed...leaving only Sumaru behind...\n\n(Everyone is shocked.)\n\nTATSUYA: In the World of Collective Unconsciousness, where we fought\nhim, strong beliefs became reality...By resetting our meeting 10 years\nago, we created another reality in exchange for the truths and memories\nuntil then...\n\nBAOFU: So that's this reality...\n\nTATSUYA: Maya told us to forget about her...To accept everything and\nmove on...But we couldn't stand it...That's why we made this reality, to\ntrade for our memories and we escaped here...Hanging on to a faint\nhope..to remember....\n\nULALA: .........\n\nTATSUYA: A hope like that couldn't happen...My freinds that meshed in\nThis Side forgot about the Other Side, and each other...But...I...\n\nBAOFU: So that's why Amano and that Jun kid don't remember about the\nOther Side...\n\nNATE: No wonder we natives of \"This Side\" don't have a memory of the\n\"Other Side\"...\n\nELLEN: We don't have a memory of the \"Other Side\", because we are\nnatives of \"This Side\"...\n\nTATSUYA: But that could change...\"He\" said I was \"the Paradox\"...This\nreality exists on the concept of the resetting of us five...If we all\nregain our memories, the distortion between the two worlds will\ngrow...And this world will cease to exist...\n\n(Everyone is shocked.)\n\nTATSUYA: I don't want Maya to be involved anymore...I'm sure you\nunderstand now...Please stay out of this...\n\nBAOFU: What were we talking about Serizawa?\n\nULALA: I don't know. Shouldn't the adults be the ones fooling the kids?\n\nKATSUYA: No...It's about adults taking responsibility for children's\nactions...\n\nTATSUYA (shocked): ............(mad) You tricked me...\n\n*MAYA: Dummy...! Look at you!*\n\n(Maya slaps Tatsuya and everyone is surprised.)\n\nTATSUYA: I-I...\n\n(Maya slaps Tatsuya again.)\n\nTATSUYA: I'm sorry...I understand...please don't get mad...\n\n(NATE'S ROUTE)\n\nNATE: Ha...I guess my work is done here...You're surrounded by good\nadults boy...You had better appreciate what they do for you.\n\nKATSUYA: What are you going to do...?\n\nNATE: I'm going to walk a path I believe in. I'll do all I can to end\nchaos in the city.\n\nBAOFU: Heh...If we're both still alive, let's knock one back together...\n\n(Nate nods his head and the screen goes black. Nate has left the group\nand Tatsuya joins.)\n\n(ELLEN'S ROUTE)\n\nELLEN: I guess this is it for my part...Tatsuya...now, it's a fight for\nyou and all...Take really good care of Ms. Amano.\n\nULALA: What are you going to do, Ellen?\n\nELLEN: With Nate, I'll help the people in this city. I will keep my\npromise. For myself.\n\nULALA: Your smile looks better! You'll be just fine. Good luck!\n\n(Ellen nods her head and the screen goes black. Ellen has left the group\nand Tatsuya joins.)\n\nCITY MAP: RENGEDAI\n\nKATSUYA: We've wasted so much time...We'd better hurry and catch up with\nTatsuzou, before it's too late.\n\nBAOFU: Kandori and that woman said that bastard headed for\nTorifune...how can we find it?\n\nTATSUYA: They created Torifune with a rumor, so if you follow the rumor\nabout the underground, you should find it...\n\n\nGATTEN SUSHI\n\nTATSUYA: Maya. Do you remember this is Eikichi's house? Eikichi...he's\nnot here...\n\nULALA: You must be puzzled Ma-ya.  I mean, you're dead on the Other\nSide..Well...You might not have any feeling of reality though.\n\n\nSUMARU PRISON\n\nTTSUYA:: A live house...I haven't touched a guitar for awhile.\n\n(The key to add Tatsuya to the Flamenco Contact.)\n\nTATSUYA: This is...the first place we met the Joker.  Not the same Joker\nfrom \"This Side\". ..I'm talking about my...our friend.\n\n\nHIRASAKA SATOMI TADASHI\n\nULALA: Hmm, I wonder if Satomi Tadashi was popular on the \"Other Side\"\ntoo? Hey Ma-ya, let's ask.\n\nTATSUYA: Satomi Tadashi...? I'm not sure if it was popular, but I did go\nthere often.\n\n\nIZAKAYA SHIRASHI\n\nTATSUYA: ...Why?...This place is different from the \"Other Side\"... Too\ndifferent!\n\nBAOFU: So this shop differs on the \"Other Side\". He doesn't have to be\nthat shocked, does he?\n\nULALA: So can only Tatsuya know the difference between here and the\n\"Other Side\"? ...Ah, can you tell too, Ma-ya?\n\nKATSUYA: I'm sure it's not as if only this shop is different from the\n\"Other Side\".  Maybe he just hasn't noticed everything else.\n\n\nKASU HIGH ROOFTOP\n\nKATSUYA: On the \"Other Side\" I wasn't able to help...But not here.  As\nthe brother of Tatsuya, as protector of Justice, I will aid you!\n\nMALE STUDENT: Did you watch TV today?...Wang Long fortune telling is\nsaying the pole shift is caused by New World Order?...What should we do?\n\nYASUO: You don't know anything, do you?... First off, it's \"Did you\nwatch the news on TV today\", not \"Did you watch TV?\" ... The outside\nworld has nothing to do with us... Our wolrd consists of just \"school\".\nOur worth as humans is decided here...\n\n\nYUMEZAKI SATOMI TADASHI\n\nULALA: Tatsuya just told me about a good diet food.  He knows someone\nwho knows a lot about that stuff!\n\n\nMU CONTINENT\n\nKATSUYA: I bet you enjoyed gambling on the \"Other Side\" too..I don't\nhave to ask Tatsuya to tell.\n\n\nPEACE DINER\n\nULALA: But I wonder...What am I like on the \"Other Side\"?  Maybe I was a\ncelebrity?\n\nKATSUYA: Judging from that, it seems Tatsuya amd I are not on good terms\nover on the \"Other Side\"\neither...\n\nTATSUYA: I see...Even on This Side she talks like a ninja...I guess it\ncan't be helped.\n\n\nROSA CANDIDA\n\nTATSUYA: That cave was different on the \"Other Side\" as well...Of\ncourse...Because there is no Masquerade here...\n\n\nLUNAR PALACE\n\nKATSUYA: It seems that on the \"Other Side\", this room is the same...Just\nlook at Tatsuya.\n\nTATSUYA: ...Actually, I never planned to come back here\nagain......EVER...\n\n\nSUMARU GENIE\n\nBAOFU: I heard from Tatsuya on the \"Other Side\", that mystic was a\nrumormonger. As I thought, it's slightly different.\n\n\nKUZUNOHA\n\nTATSUYA: The rumor was manipulated on the Other Side. Although I was\nhelped in many other ways, I bet they wouldn't know me... But are prices\nhigher on \"This Side\"?  That Lucky Cat asked for only 100 on the \"Other\nSide\"...\n\nKATSUYA: Tatsuya and those guys must've been using this place on the\nOther Side like us...However, with a difference of 900 Yen.\n\nBAOFU: Uhhuuuuuh, even on the \"Other Side\"...This ol' man is suspicious\ntoo...Could he already be aware about Tatsuya?\n\nTAMMY: New World Order's goal is an ambitious one.  It was beyodg my\nimagination. Be careful, Ms. Amano.\n\n\nSUBWAY\n\n(Maya and the group enter inside the train and Maya takes the driver\nseat.)\n\nULALA: Maybe they used this subway to transport stuff?  There's food and\nall kinds of stuff.\n\nBAOFU: Hmph, who're they kidding...They set this thing up and tried to\nmake a rumor come true, they must be insane...\n\nKATSUYA: Um, Ms. Amano, are you sure you can drive? Perhaps I should,\ninstead?\n\n(Maya shakes her head no and she starts to drive.  While riding......)\n\nTATSUYA: .......\n\nBAOFU: .....\n\nULALA: Hey Tatsuya I found some drinks, want some?\n\n(Tatsuya shakes his head no and Ulala sits down.)\n\nULALA: Hey, Tatsuya...Something's been bugging me...Why are you the only\none who recalls the \"Other Side\"?\n\nTATSUYA: .....\n\nBAOFU: Don't have to say what you don't want to...Besides...What I want\nto know is what are WE like on the \"Other Side\"?  We were there, right?\n\nTATSUYA: My brother is pretty much the same...Ulala was scammed by a con\nartist...I only know you spread rumors on the net...\n\nBAOFU: So the \"Other Side\" is not that different...\n\nTATSUYA: ..........Is it hard...being an adult?\n\nBAOFU: Huh?\n\nTATSUYA: No...never mind...Forget about it...\n\nBAOFU: What about you?\n\nTATSUYA: .........\n\nBAOFU: It's the same...There's nothing good. The pain just keeps\ngrowing...\n\nULALA: ........\n\nKATSUYA / MAYA: ..........\n\nKATSUYA: Hmm...? Ms. Amano, it's a dead end...Please stop.\n\n(Maya stops the train.)\n\nBAOFU: Welcome to the \"Gates of Hell\"...Worry about everything\nlater...You're still young...You got lots of time. That is, if you stay\nalive...\n\n\nSUBWAY CONSTRUCTION SITE:\n\n(Talk to members)\n\nULALA: Adults, huh...? What are adults anyway?\n\nTATSUYA: I guess we have to walk from here...We can't just go back\neasily.  This is our last chance to turn back...\n\n(If you decide to leave)\n\nTATSUYA: Maya...are we going back...?\n\n*MAYA: No, no, it's nothing.*\n\n\nBAOFU'S LAIR (after being in the Subway)\n\nULALA: I was tricked by him on the \"Other Side\" after all. Huh...Just\nlike Ma-ya's flashback...\n\nBAOFU: It seems I was collecting rumors over there too.  Not very\ndifferent from here...At one time I was kinda curious about an alternate\nworld...But it's actually pretty boring.\n\n\nOUTSIDE AMENO TORIFUNE:\n\n(Maya and co. are underground and they see the Ameno Torifune in the\ndistance.)\n\n\nAMENO TORIFUNE CONTROL ROOM\n\n(The scene cuts to the Control Room.  Tatsuzou is standing on a\nplattform and his 4 NWO executives and General Sugawara are right behind\nhim.  Tenchu Soldiers and Scientists are watching him from below.)\n\nTATSUZOU: Tenchu soldiers! Finally , the prophecy of Torifune has come\ntrue! Gozen awaits! All we need to do now is release Joka to cleanse the\nkegare of the world by the hands of the 12 Dragons!!\n\n(The crowd cheers.)\n\nTATSUZOU: We ask! What has human history been up 'til now!!  Various\nreligions! Tribes! Desires! Values! Was the human history laden with\nthese, a history of \"sin\"!!? The masses blessed with material, lost\ntheir ideals. They don't examine themselves or even try to atone for\ntheir sins! We must provide a dream of reconstructing a new future and\ncleanse the rotting world!  This is the \"Punishment\"!!! And the chosen\nones will know!!! The future of salvation stands before us!\n\n(The crowd cheers again and the screen darkens and moves to Sugawara.)\n\nGENERAL SUGAWARA: You twisted bastard...\n\n(The screen lightens up again.)\n\nTATSUZOU: Sugawara...\n\nGENERAL SUGAWARA: Yessir...\n\nTATSUZOU: I leave the Torifune to you.  We will ascend to Utena with\nGozen.  Prepare the Petit Deva...\n\nGENERAL SUGAWARA:  Yessir...it shall be done.\n\nTATSUZOU: Do not worry about your frailty, my freind...Gozen is very\nhappy with your work. Your wish for immortality will be granted.\n\nGENERAL SUGAWARA: Ah...! My loyalty has finally been rewarded...\n\nTATSUZOU: Your body might change slightly though...\n\nGENERAL SUGAWARA: What was that?\n\n(Tatsuzou and his 4 NWO executives leave.)\n\n\nOUTSIDE THE TORIFUNE\n\nBAOFU: Hmmm...Impressive...\n\nTATSUYA: Well, considering it can fly with a city on top of it, it\nbetter be...\n\nULALA: This is rumored to be a ship of a god or aliens, right...? Don't\nyou think they would've set traps or something?\n\nTATSUYA: This ship, called \"Xibalba\" on the \"Other Side\", makes bad\nthoughts real...You shouldn't think of anything bad.\n\nKATSUYA: How do you know...?\n\nTATSUYA: People's fear...insecurity...hopes...It borrows the form of\nrumors, it is the incarnation of the unconscious world...\n\n(Tatsuya flicks his lighter.)\n\nTATSUYA: I think that's why Philemon said thoughts would become reality\nin the unconscious world...\n\nULALA: Then all we gotta do is think pleasant thoughts...Piece of\ncake...\n\nTATSUYA: No...This is his domain...Don't think anything...\n\n(Maya and co. enter and inside, the whole room is hot and the party is\ngoing crazy.)\n\nKATSUYA: It, It's no use...! The door won't budge!\n\nBAOFU: Yow! Hot!...What's going on!? Serizawa! You thought of something\nbad, didn't you!?\n\nULALA: Yow! Hot!...It, It's not me!!!\n\nTATSUYA: ...I'm sorry. It was something that happened\npreviously......So...I inadvertently...\n\nBAOFU / ULALA: Wh, Wha-----t!?\n\nKATSUYA: It's no use talking about what we thought!  So what happened on\nthe \"Other Side\", Tatsuya!?\n\nTATSUYA: ...I ran.\n\nBAOFU / KATSUYA / ULALA: Ahhhh!?\n\nTATSUYA: \"If you concertrate, even an oven is cool!\" ...Is what Maya\nsaid.\n\n(Maya does her positive gesture and she and Tatsuya go ahead.  Ulala\ntrips and then catches up to them.)\n\nKATSUYA: That's unreasonable...\n\nBAOFU: You gotta be kiddin' me!? Yow! Hot! This is not my idea of fun...\n\n(Baofu and Katsuya catch up with Maya and the others.)\n\nBAOFU / KATSUYA: Uoooooh?!? My sunglasses are melting off my face!!!\n\n(The party enters inside the Torifune.)\n\n\nAMENO TORIFUNE\n\nROOM OF INSULT\n\n(Dead Tenchu Soldiers are lying on the ground in a pool of blood.)\n\nKATSUYA: This is the Tenchu Army. It seems that they were caught in a\ntrap...\n\nULALA: Is this also the work of that \"Nyar-something\"!? ...Isn't it\nweird!?...Why does he kill his own men...!\n\nTATSUYA: It's proof that the New World Order isn't aware of the secret\nof the Torifune...\"He\" thinks of humans as mere pawns...They probaly\ndon't even know of \"his\" existence.\n\n(Talk to Members)\n\nTATSUYA: This ship...him...Neither one anything a human should mess\nwith...\n\nBAOFU: I don't care about the Crawling Chaos, but I'm not letting them\nget away...I'm gonna be the one to kill Tatsuzou...\n\n\nROOM OF DAMNATION\n\nULALA: Hey everyone, wait up a sec...Let's walk a little slower...\n\nBAOFU: Suck it up...If you can't keep up, we're leaving you...\n\nULALA: It can't be helped...I don't walk this much even at work. Isn't\nthere a place to recover?\n\nKATSUYA: It HAS been a while we've been underground. If there was a\nVelvet Room, we could rest there...\n\nTATSUYA: It's there...A Fountain, a Velvet Room...\n\nULALA: Really...!?\n\nKATSUYA: It's awfully suspicious...That Nyarlathotep guy decides wether\nor not to make our thoughts a reality, right? Why does he give things so\nconviently?\n\nTATSUYA: He's playing with us...\n\nBAOFU: I don't know what he's up to, but if I can use it, then I will...\n\n(Baofu and Ulala go in one door while Katsuya goes in one door alone.\nTatsuya begins to sit down and Maya sits next to him.)\n\nMAYA: .........\n\nTATSUYA: .........\n\nMAYA: .........\n\n(Tatsuya gets up.)\n\nTATSUYA: .........\n\n*MAYA: Th, Thank you for saving me...!*\n\nTATSUYA: This is...the burden of sin...\n\nTATSUYA: You...don't have to worry about me...\n\n(Metal forms of Jun, Eikichi, and Lisa come out from the doors.)\n\nTATSUYA: Wh...at...!?\n\nMETAL LISA: Why...Why is my only Chinyan (darling) next to Maya!?\n\nMETAL EIKICHI: That's cruel...Tatsu...You don't care about us?\n\n(Maya and Tatsuya draw thier weapons.)\n\nTATSUYA: Get back...!!! These are...illusions that my heart called!\n\n(Tatsuya strikes Jun, but Jun is not affected.)\n\nTATSUYA: Damn!\n\nMETAL JUN: Tatsuya...Was the promise to protect Maya a lie...?\n\nTATSUYA: .........\n\nMETAL JUN: It's okay...You don't have to suffer by yourself anymore...\n\n(The Metal kids disappear along with Tatsuya and Maya panics. Then the\nothers come out from the doors.)\n\nULALA: Huh...? Where's Tatsuya?\n\n(Maya explains what happened.)\n\nKATSUYA: What did you say...!?\n\nBAOFU: Ch...! We fell for it...Come on! We gotta find him!\n\n(Talk to party members)\n\nULALA: Oh, come on Ma-ya! What were you doing!!!...Wait...I'm the one\nmostly at fault...\n\nBAOFU: They pulled a dirty trick on us..I like his style...Too bad it\nwon't do him any good...\n\nKATSUYA: Damn...Tatsuya's letting his pride get in the way. He's trying\nto carry the weight of the world\non his shoulders...!\n\n\nTORIFUNE B6\n\nKATSUYA: Tatsuya's still alive...We must hurry...\n\n\nROOM OF GUILT\n\n(The place is Araya Shrine. Tatsuya is tied onto an altar with the Metal\nkids standing over him.)\n\nMETAL EIKICHI: \"We went through a lot, but I'm glad we met again...\"\n\nMETAL LISA: \"Chinyan (darling)...Don't forget about me...\"\n\nMETAL JUN: \"I won't forget...the sin I commited, you or anyone...\"\nTatsuya...Have you forgotten?\n\nTATSUYA: How can I...forget...\n\nMETAL LISA: But...you broke an important promise, didn't you...?\n\nMETAL EIKICHI: That's why...you're suffering, right...?\n\nTATSUYA: I'm sorry...\n\nMETAL JUN: Tatsuya...You can stop suffering...Let us ease you\nsuffering...?\n\n(Jun tries to stab Tatsuya, but Tatsuya stops it with his hand.)\n\nTATSUYA: Jun...I'll accept my punishment...But...not now...\n\n(Maya and co. jump in and the Boss Battle Theme from Persona 2: Innocent\nSin plays.)\n\nKATSUYA: Tatsuya!!\n\n(Katsuya fires shots but doesn't affect the kids.)\n\nBAOFU: Ch...Physical attacks don't even scratch 'em!\n\nTATSUYA: .........!?\n\n(Enter Battle)\n\nMETAL JUN: It's okay...You can stop suffering...\n\nTATSUYA: I'll accept my punishment...But...not now...!\n\n(After Battle)\n\n(The room is back to normal and Katsuya is tending to Tatsuya's wounds.)\n\nKATSUYA: I thought I taught you to hold a knife by its handle...\n\nTATSUYA: I'm sorry...\n\nKATSUYA: Don't say anything. My brother doesn't lower his head for\nlittle things like this...\n\nTATSUYA: No...The me of \"This Side\", also feels the same way...\n\nKATSUYA: I see...\n\nULALA: How can you two be brothers?\n\n(Talk to Members)\n\nTATSUYA: I'm sorry Maya...I troubled you...\n\n\nROOM OF TRANSPORT\n\nKATSUYA: Tatsuya...What is this?\n\nTATSUYA: I think it's some sort of teleportation device...it was another\nsymbol in the \"Other Side\"...\n\nULALA: It's called...\"Petite Deva\". It's written here.\n\nBAOFU: The symbol of Kandori...If we use this, we might be able to get\nback to the city.\n\n\nCONTROL ROOM\n\n(Maya and co. enter and there are dead soldiers all covered in blood,\nKatsuya checks one soldier's body.)\n\nKATSUYA: He has a pulse...!!!\n\nSOLDIER OF THE TENCHU ARMY: S...Save me...I don't...wanna die...\n\nKATSUYA: ...It's alright...You're not gonna die...What happened...?\n\nSOLDIER OF THE TENCHU ARMY:\nGeneral...became...monster......Everyone...killed...\nTell...daughter...grab...your dream...\n\nMAYA / KATSUYA : .........\n\nCREEPY VOICE: I......TAAAAIeeee...\n\nULALA: W, What...!?\n\nTATSUYA: .........!?\n\n(General Sugawara, who is now become a monster appears.)\n\nWAS SUGAWARA: Aaaarrrgh!!! It hurts!!!\n\n(A sound is heard and the party turns around to look at the screen.  An\nFMV is shown of Sumaru Castle rising out near Seven Sisters High School.\nThe walls of the Torifune surround Sumaru City and it rises up\ninto the air.)\n\nMAYA: .........!!!\n\nULALA: You're kidding me...?\n\nKATSUIYA: What, have they done!?\n\nBAOFU: Ch...!!!\n\n(enter battle)\n\nTATSUYA: Ugh...But, it's not too late...!!\n\nTATSUYA: Sudou is probaly in that castle...! He still has to do the\nDragon Ritual...!!! We haven't lost yet...!!!\n\n(after battle)\n\n(Maya, Baofu, and Katsuya are firing shots at Sugawara and then Tatsuya\npushes him off the plattform using his sword.)\n\nWAS SUGAWARA: Aaaarrrgh!!\n\nKATSUYA: I don't care if you're immortal or not...You lose...\n\n(a moment later)\n\nBAOFU: It's no good, it's not budging an inch...We couldn't land this\nship even if we wanted to...\n\nULALA: What are we gonna do!?...The city's flying...At this rate, the\ndragons will appear, and the earth's axis will rotate!\n\nKATSUYA: As long as we're alive, we can stop him...Tatsuya is right. We\nhaven't lost yet...We're gonna bring this ship down the way we're gonna\nbring down Sudou! Even if he has backup!\n\nBAOFU: That's fine, but looking at the teleport device he used, we can't\nstand around...A bit late, but we're going back up!!\n\n\nARAYA SHRINE\n\nBAOFU: Hmmm...It looks like we caught the last ride out of there...\n\n(Sumaru City is now in the air.  The City Map music is different (it's a\nremix of the previous City Map Music.) and Sumaru Castle is now located\nwhere Honmaru Park used to be. You can also get rumors from\n2X Slash and Johnny Rogers and bring Clair de Lune to Aoba and Padparcha\nin Konan.)\n\nRENGEDAI SATOMI TADASHI:\n\nTATSUYA: Ch...The Ameno Torifune...Even the shape is the same as the\nXibalba...\n\nHIRASAKA SATOMI TADASHI:\n\nSALAM LADEEN: Is it okay for a city to fly? Did the Lord allow it?\nNo...I must go. But the land is more\ndangerous...\n\n\nTOMI CHIROPRACTOR:\n\nTATSUYA: Sumaru Castle....it was just a park on the Other Side...As I\nfigured, it's different from before.\n\n\nIZAKAYA SHIRASHI:\n\nSHIRASHI LADY: Something like this happened before. Xibalba...?Ohh...I'm\ngetting a funny feeling.\nSUMARU PRISON:\n\nKEN: Wonder what happened to Michel!? When it is like this, we got to be\nworried! But I bet Ms. Miyabi is even more worried.\n\nMIYABI: Eikichi is very lucky, isn't he? He has so many great\ncompanions. I will believe in Eikichi's return and wait here.\nKASU HIGH ROOFTOP:\n\nMALE STUDENT: Yasuo!!!...Look at Narumi! It's all messed up!?\n\nYASUO: Looking from up here, everything looks so small...(sigh)...If I\njust realized sooner, my life might've been different....What...do I\nwant to do?\n\nBIKINI LINE:\n\nTATSUYA: It is lucky that at least the temple didn't come out. Even the\nslightest difference from the Other Side is good.\n\nAKI DUDE: What happened to me?...A while ago, I had a dream this city\nwas flying in the air...Could it have been a prophecy?\n\nSEEDY CD:\n\nSTORE OWNER: It's funny, but I'm not surprised that this city's flying.\nWas there something like this before? There wasn't, right?\n\nIXQUIC: Oh, misses! Big problem, big problem!!! There's a faster demon\nnow! Now it's 200 km/h Fogey!! The kids in the neighborhood said they\nsaw it at The Seedy CD!!! I must fulfill my duty as the transmigrated\nwarrior maiden! Demons that threaten human's lives, I shall whoop your\nasses!\n\n(Spread the rumor, fight the 200 km/h Fogey and recieve the Top Speed\nTitle. Show it to Ixquic.)\n\nIXQUIC: What the...!? The thing that you have...Isn't it Top Speed\nTitle!? Wow...Misses, you already beat up the 200 km/h Fogey? Are you a\ntransmigrated warrior, too? Please! Can you trade that Top-Speed Title\nwith my treasure? I REALLY need that! PLEASE!!!\n\n*MAYA: (Trade)*\n\nIXQUIC: Really!? Yaaaaaaaay!!! Okay then, here's your Legenbright.\nThanks, Misses!!!\n\nIXQUIC: Now that I think about it, I feel I've met you before. I wonder\nif this is also memories from my previous life...\n\nJOHNNY ROGERS\n\nULALA: I see...Everyone thinks the events that happened on the \"Other\nSide\" are dreams or something.\n\nTATSUYA: There are more people who saw the same spectacle. It's proof\nthat the world is starting to\ndisappear...At this rate...\n\nRUMORMONGER BARKKEPER: So this a prophetic dream...I dreamt awhile back\nthat the city was floating. The ship below was called the \"Xibalba\"...\n\nSUMARU GENIE\n\nTATSUYA: Ulala asked me what I was called on the \"Other Side\"...All I\ndid was answer...\n\nULALA:Awwwwwwwwwe...Tatsuya was called \"Tatsu\" over on the \"Other Side\".\n\nKATSUYA: \"Tatsu\", huh...It's not a bad nicknam. Hmm? Then what about me?\n\n\nHIIRAGI THERAPY:\n\nULALA: Ma-ya! Mary went out on her own! Is she okay?\n\nREIKO: Mary went outside. She said she couldn't leave the city as it\nis...I hope she's alright...\n\nPADPARCHA:\n\nTATSUYA:\"Everyone has the right to grasp a dream\". That is what you said\non the Other Side, but do I really have the right to grasp one?...\n\n\nSUMARU TV:\n\nCORPSE OF A TENCHU SOLDIER: (Looks like he was a member of the Civil\nDefense Force. He's already stopped breathing.)\n\nBRAD: Da ha ha ha...What happened? You look so surprised. Are you\nsurprised by my activity? Da ha ha ha! ...Well, that's the deal, so you\nguys go on to the Sumaru Castle without any worry. I'll show the people\nof the city just how way cool I am.\n\nMAMI: It seems Lisa hasn't come home yet either. Where could she have\ngone at a time like this...? Even this place would have been in danger\nif it weren't for Mr. Brad Uesugi...Her father must be worried as well.\n\nMIHO: Did you know? Brad Uesugi is very powerful! He may be a good match\nfor Lisa's father. But based on impact, Lisa's dad wins! He's REALLY\nscary when he's mad. He does not say a word!

There was once a Sumaru Castle, and now there is\na Sumaru Castle at the same location...That's all.\n\nTATSUYA: It's just like Baofu said...The Sumaru Castle wasn't on the\n\"Other Side\"...But it is on \"This Side\"...That's all.\n\n\nKISMET EDITORIAL ROOM:\n\nFUJII: Eh, Yukki? Yukki went out to protect everybody...To stop the\nTenchu Army. I'm going to record\nthis real event in its entirety on film. That's the onlt thing I can\ndo....That is my cuase.\n\n\nMIZUNO'S OFFICE:\n\nEDITOR-IN-CHIEF MIZUNO: Amano!...Get that man out of here! I let him in\nbecuase the Editor-in-Chief of Moo magazine insisted. I found out it was\nto get rid of him! There's no time for that!!\n\nMR. KASHIHARA: Hello there...I checked the legend about this incident,\nand I found out something incredible! I thought I thought I had to let\nthe Editor-in-Chief of Moo magazine know about this...It's a little\nlong, but would you listen?\n\n*MAYA: This isn't Moo.*\n\nMR. KASHIHARA: Oh really?...I'm terribly sorry.\n\n(A moment later)\n\nEDITOR-IN-CHIEF MIZUNO: Who was that man...?\n\n\nPARABELLUM:\n\nMATSUOKA: With the surfacing of Ameno Torifune, and the show of the\nTenchu Army, this city's in more chaos than ever...But, don't\nworry...Leave the safety of the people to us.  Master Nate is battling\nthe Tenchu Army with his comrades. Master Amano, you have a mission to\naccomplish...Please hurry to Sumaru Castle.\n\nRUMOR-LOVIN' BARTENDER: Oh welcome! I'm so glad, you are unharmed...Huh,\nme? There was a rumor amongour regulars that Narumi was in danger. You\nwouldn't want anything to happen for real, right?\nThen right when I moved just to be safe....Now this world is really\ngoing to end? Ah, but at least we're still safe.\n\nRUMOR-LOVIN' BARTENDER: Do you know the purging of the Tenchu Army? They\nkill those who have Kegare in them...Please watch out!\n\nSUMARU CASTLE\n\nSTATUE OF JOKA: I am Joka...The one who opens the door to Utena...it is\nsuggested to solemly offer\nancient prayers...\n\nSTATUE OF FUKUGI: I am Fukugi...Prayers of Kotodama, the spirited\nwords...You should gather the 7\nKotodama and offer ancient prayers....\n\n(talk to party members)\n\nULALA: This is the \"Big Dipper\", right? There's one more in between the\nstatues..What's that one?\n\nBAOFU: There's no door connecting to the back...So those lights lead to\nsomewhere....\n\nKATSUYA: Prayers? Seven Kotodama...? Are they saying if we don't figure\nthis out, we won't be able to open Utena's door?\n\nTATSUYA: A black hole...That means trouble...\n\n\nKEGARE CHAMBER\n\n(Talk to party members)\n\nBAOFU: We can't just destroy that thing without giving it some thought\nfirst...They saved up some pretty nasty things.\n\nULALA: How much is in there...? The back is all hazy, so I can't see...\n\nKATSUYA: The Kegare they got from the people...They're transporting\nit...somewhere...\n\nTATSUYA: I cannot run away from my sin....so easily...I have to atone\nfor my sin by myself...\n\nCHAMBER OF HENBAI\n\nPLAINSPHERE LITHOGRAPH: One who knoweth the intention of the 7 Kotodama.\nThou shalt offer the great paryer.\n\n(PASSWORD IS PERSEUS)\n\nPLAINSPHERE LITHOGRAPH: One who realizes the intention of the Seven\nSpirits offer the Henbai of Perseus, and walk the path to the stage. If\nthou completest this, the Hokutoku Gohou shall be unbound, and\nthe path to the Stage shall open.\n\nKATSUYA: I did some research prior to coming here. Perseus is a\nconstellation named after the man who slew Medusa in Greek mythology.\nMany people of ancient times believed in the stars, and it's no surprise\nthat Perseus was picked. He was a heroic figure. It IS a bit odd for\nthem to use a Western name, but people today have strange ideas of\nmagic. Another effect of rumors, I guess.\n\nULALA: Wow, you're such a hardworking guy. So what's a \"henbai\"?\n\nKATSUYA: Henbai is a type of \"magical stepping\" that originated in\nChina. With this, you crush evil stars and invite good luck. Hokutoku is\na magic where  you draw Ursa Major on the earth to sanctify and protect\nthat area...Most likely, it means to walk in a certain pattern, or\nsomething like that...\n\n\nCHAMBER OF UTENA\n\n(The Four NWO executives are lying dead becuase Tatsuzou Sudou killed\nthem with a sword, the party comes inside and confronts him.)\n\nKATSUYA: Sudou...!? You bastard...!!!\n\nBAOFU: You've finally gone mad...Tatsuzou!!!\n\nTATSUZOU: Mad you say...? This world is what's gone mad!  Tell me what\nis stirring this country!!\n\nTATSUZOU: Fronts, fatigue, and contradictions...People think only of\nthemselves!! And so, punishment will be yours again!! This world is\ndecayed..The law, the system, and all humans who live off of it!!!\n\nKATSUYA: Damn you, Tatsuzou! What right do you have to judge us!?\n\nBAOFU: That's bullshit...Deceiving people with stupid curses...Your\ndeception ends here, old man!\n\nTATSUZOU: Fools...You don't understand human nature.  Curses and\nfortunes were things you wanted! Look down there! People are still\ncurious about fortunes, jinxes, and wish for good luck...You cannot stop\na heart that involunterily pumps its blood for curses!... Or the pulsing\npower of life it brings!\n\nTATSUZOU: Arise, Gozen! I have delivered you the Kegare of my sinful\ncompratriots! Let people's words become a reality!!!\n\n(An FMV plays of the dragons being summoned from around the world, and\nthey all gather at Sumaru Castle.)\n\nULALA / MAYA: Oh my God!\n\nTATSUZOU: Hahaha!! Hya--hahaha!! Behold!! The Earth Dragon will destroy\nEarth along with Joka!! The axis will shift and people shall die!! I\nhave transformed history!! What is life if you can't even bear this!?\n\n(Tatsuzou starts to shake.)\n\nTATSUZOU: Gwo..!?

A.K.A Kiyotada Sumaru.)\n\n(enter battle)\n\nTATSUYA: I see...You won't come out until I defeat this guy...\n\nGOZEN: Who are you, to awaken me from my slumber!?\n\n(After Battle)\n\n(Gozen lies on the floor.)\n\nBAOFU: Did we do it...!?\n\n(Gozen explodes into pink energy.)\n\nKATSUYA: That can't be...What the hell is that...!?\n\n(An FMV plays of Sumaru City in chaos. The dragons disappear, the\nTorifune walls twist and crumble, and Sumaru City is being sucked into\nan unknown dimension.

It suits me, don't you agree?\n\nTATSUYA: Shut up...!!!\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Humans are strange...I came here because you wanted to\nmeet me...Now you want me to go? You're contradicting yourself...\n\nNYARLATHOTEP (as Ulala): By the way...do you know the \"three poisons of\nlife\"?...What I'm referring to is \"Anger\", \"Ignorance\", and \"Vengeance\".\n\nNYARLATHOTEP (as Baofu): There are countless others, but these are my\nprimary sources of power.\n\nNYARLATHOTEP (as Katsuya): Oh, come now...You disappoint me...It's\nreally simple...Even your pathetic brain can comprehend that...\n\nKATSUYA: Are you trying to say...that you are the \"shadow\" of us\nhumans!?\n\nNYARLATHOTEP (as Maya): So, you do understand...I am a reflection of\nyour true selves...Let's play one last game...\n\n(Eikichi, Jun, and Lisa appear, but they are chained up in the air and\nNyarlathotep reverts back to his Tatsuya form.)\n\nTATSUYA: Jun...Eikichi...Lisa!!!\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: You remember what I told you, right? If they remember the\nOther Side, then this world will cease to exist.  You of all people\nshould understand...Right, Tatsuya?

Well, I\nsaved the best for last...We must show your secret to your freinds.\nRight, \"Paradox Boy\"?...\n\n\nFLASHBACK: NYARLATHOTEP'S LAIR\n\n(This shows the continuing scene from the final flashback at Mt. Iwato\nafter Maya dies.)\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Huhahahahaha!!! You have learned something. The reality of\nthe world..There are things that you have no control over! I am the\nshadow of all humans. As long as humans have dark hearts, I will live.\nFace the last trial of the Crawling Chaos!!!\n\n(Nyarlathotep changes into a monster-like creature and disappears along\nwith Maya Okamura.)\n\nPHILEMON: There is a way to change this reality. You must forget about\nthat one summer day...Nyarlathotep began weaving the threads of fate\nthat day...If we erase that instance, this tragedy would never have\noccured. A new time woven and a world reborn...\n\nEIKICHI: You can...do that...?\n\nPHILEMON: Realize this...A human's heart possess the power to change the\nflow of reality. Even without the Xilbalba or the Crystal Skull, your\nstrong will and action have the energy to change reality. Even the\npower that created the cosmos you live in is the same as yours..In this\ncollective unconsciousness, it is\npossible.\n\nJUN: Do you mean start over from the beginning?  In return for\nour...memories...?\n\nGINKO: You mean...forget everyone...!? I...I don't want to!!  Isn't\nthere another way!?\n\nPHILEMON: Not in this world, where he has power. The dark hearts of\npeople unconsciously doing world destruction is his source of power...In\norder to suppress him, people must change...You will create the new\nworld...\n\nJUN: I...won't forget...How can I forget...\n\nEIKICHI: Hell yeah...I ain't gonna forget...!! If everything was set up\nby him, then let's do it...Let's teach him that things won't go his way\nanymore...\n\nGINKO: We...WILL...meet again, right...?\n\nPHILEMON: Then see yourself as who you should be. Your powers should\nmold a new reality.\n\n(Jun disappears, then Eikichi, and then the dead Maya. Lisa walks up to\nTatsuya to give him a kiss.)\n\nGINKO: A kiss...So that I won't forget about my Tatsuya...\n\n(Lisa disappears.)\n\nPHILEMON: Well then...We will part for a short time. Are there any final\nwords you want to say?\n\n*TATSUYA: (Hit Him)*\n\n(Tatsuya punches Philemon and Philemon's mask comes off.  His face is\nthe same as Tatsuya's.)\n\nPHILEMON: I am the one who exists in the boundary between the\nconsciousness and the unconsciousness...I am you and you are I...I will\nalways be watching from within you...Farewell...\n\n(Tatsuya disappears.)\n\n(An FMV plays of the kids saying goodbye to each other)\n\nEIKICHI: We went through a lot, but I'm glad we met again. Don't forget\nwhat you promised dude.\n\nLISA: Tatsuya...Don't forget me...I do love you.\n\nJUN: You won't forget, or say goodbye. Just thank you.\n\nTATSUYA: I don't want to forget what happened! How can I forget?   Guys,\ndon't go...Don't leave me alone...Please no, please no.  No!....(echoes)\n\n(Tatsuya disappears. FMV ends there.)\n\n\nREALITY\n\nKATSUYA / MAYA / BAOFU / ULALA: .........!!!\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: (chuckles) How's that, Tatsuya Suou!? Do you like your\npunishment?  You couldn't ask them to fight with you. That's because the\nsole reason the world is at the brink of destruction\nis...YOU!!!\n\nTATSUYA: .........\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: You broke your promise with your freinds. The condition to\nstay in this world was to give up your memories from the old world!!!\nBut you rejected it, ...At that moment, the boundary\nseperating the 2 worlds vacillated...That was you!!! That's why you\nfailed to synchronize with the you of this world...\n\nMAYA: .........\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Push all the pain upon your freinds, and still retain your\nmemory...That's an unforgivable sin...A sin must have punishment.\nThat's why I gave you the chance to meet her again. I coaxed fate for\nyou all to meet again.\n\nTATSUYA: Ch...\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: What's wrong?...Are you going to hide in your shell again?\nThat face of yours when you met that woman and regained your\nmemories...You should have seen it...\n\nMAYA: .........\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Am I detestable? But that is what you humans desired...You\ncraved destruction from the depths of your hearts...That is me! The\nshadow does not forgive anyone who goes against fate.\n\nBAOFU: Ahhh, shut up...You can take this fate of yours and stick it up\nyour ass!  Listen up, Tatsuya...Fate is...\n\nKATSUYA: No different than a prediction too late. If something happens,\nall you have to say is this...\n\nULALA: \"It was all fate!\"\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Muhahahaha...!!! Pathetic humans! I'll show you what\nhappened to those who said the same thing to me in the past!!!\n\n(Nyarlathotep transforms into his Moon Howler form.)\n\n(Enter Battle)\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Understand that there is no point in living! Cry, that\nthere is no answer! Where there is darkness, there are shadows! I,\nmyself, am all of you humans!!\n\nTATSUYA: I won't turn my back again...On the sin I committed..Nor on\nmyself!!\n\nTATSUYA / NYARLATHOTEP: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!\n\n(After you beat his Moon Howler form, he'll change into his true form,\nwhich is a \"mass of gods with 1000 names and faces at the center of\nspace\" as his description says.)\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Fuhahahahaha! This is! Splendid! You are the first to see\nthis form! Die with my highest praise!\n\n(After Battle)\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: It...can't be...!? It's not possible...!!! This\ncontradiction...I won't accept i--t!!!\n\n(Philemon appears in the air carrying Jun in his arms.)\n\nPHILEMON: Crawling Chaos, accept your defeat...\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Philemon!!!\n\nPHILEMON: They represent the potential of mankind. You, the dark side of\nthe collective unconsciousness, are linked to all humans. THAT is\nwhy...They...moved the hearts of the people...\n\nKATSUYA: All potential is born from chaos...I see...That's right...\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Hmph...\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: Muhahaha...!!! What irony!!! THIS is my FATE...!?\n\nNYARLATHOTEP: But...remember this...! The masses of idiocy that squim in\nthe center of the cosmos are yourselves...!!! As long as I you\nexist...so too shall I...!!!\n\nBAOFU: You're too damn stubborn...There's no such thing as a human\nwithout shadows...We'll make you remember that your place is here...Just\ngo to Hell and be done with it...\n\n(Maya shoots at Nyarlathotep and Tatsuya strikes Nyarlathotep.\nNyarlathotep screams and disappears.)\n\nULALA: It's over...\n\nTATSUYA: No...There's still...one more thing...\n\nTATSUYA: The fact remains that I'm the Paradox...If I stay here...Then\n\"This Side\" will be engulfed by the \"Other Side\"...\n\nBAOFU / KATSUYA: .........\n\nULALA / MAYA: Tatsuya...You're not...\n\nTATSUYA: I'm going home...\n\n*MAYA: Tatsuya...Thank you for everything...*\n\nTATSUYA: I made a promise to Jun...He kept his word...Now it's my\nturn...The only thing left on the Other Side is our city.  We'll rebuild\na great world...\n\nKATSUYA: Tatsuya...You...\n\n(Energy surrounds Tatsuya.)\n\nBAOFU: Tatsuya...There's one thing I forgot to tell you...There are good\nthings even when you become an adult...Just a few...\n\nTATSUYA: Yeah...I know...\n\n(Tatsuya splits into two.)\n\nKATSUYA: Tatsuya...!\n\nULALA: Tatsuya...!\n\nMAYA: .........\n\nTATSUYA FROM THE OTHER SIDE: We are connected by this ocean. We\ncan...meet again...\n\n(Tatsuya from the Other Side disappears and Tatsuya from This Side falls\non the floor.)\n\n\nThe spectre has returned to the deep corners of the subconscious, so too\nhas her love, retreated to a world beyond her reach. The city is showing\nsigns of recovery...but many will never know the truth of what happened.\nNonetheless, what Tatsuya left behind will live on in the hearts of the\npeople.

tree\n\n[Verse 1: Leaf Dog]\nThe world is well balanced like karma is\nDo you find freedom on the front line where the army is\nOr in your mind opening the left part of this\nI feel it in-between my bones just like the cartilage\nWhen I'm parting this world I won't be sad\nThe true gift was the blessing of life that I've had\nYou can think that I'm mad, Ol' Leaf's on some hippy shit\nIt took a lot of changes in me to consider it\nInspired by an old ancient manuscript\nThe Mayans did predict\nBut can you handle it\nIt's a sign of the times that's hidden in the lines\nThe description is what the indigenous define\nAssure as the sun won't shine, and the rain falling\nThe balance is untold in this life we all in\nOn this misty morning, I zone, at one\nWith the things that molded how I've grown\n\n[Verse 2: BVA MC]\nLooking at the bigger picture\nThere'll always be people like Hitler\nAnd balancing it out\nMother Teresa tryna fix the world\nThen Ghandi making sure the scales don't tip turn\nThat darker side but thats just the mix in life's elixir\nWithout bad theres no good, without wood theres no fire\nWithout the hood the posh house price wouldn't be higher\nNo stronger no weaker, no stupid no deeper\nNo dick dropping rubbish theres no work for street sweepers\nWithout life there'd be no death\nAnd that I don't stop the pain\nJust concentrate on the memories they left\nWhen I'm looking at the stars I realise\nI'm just a speck on the Earth's surface\nI measure my worth by my intellect\nWe've all got a purpose, some people got three\nSome people fall in line and others have got dreams\nWe all do our best with the tools we were given\nShit my hammer and chisel is this life that I'm living'\n\n[Hook x2: Verb T]\nLife in the balance, scales of justice\nReach for answers, but failed to touch it\nMy mind lost in this, defined by my opposite\nLife in the balance, rise to the challenge\n\n[Verse 3: Verb T]\nEight steps away\nIn fact flip that eight on its side\nBecause now I infinitely chase\nFor that intimate embrace with lady luck\nI mean fuck, how long can someone stay in a rut?\nI'm like 'no'\nYou see thats all on me, to re-evaluate my goal\nAnd forget the greed, but sometimes I think\nDo I know myself? And if not\nIs that why I can't control myself?\nI got a family man I should be responsible\nSame time mind states held in that constant ball\nThat's why my girls so stressed hey\n'Cos I get under your skin like an X-Ray\nBut lets pray that it change for the best\nDeep breath to the chest, now I'm ready for the next day\nYour in life with the next brain\nTryna be the opposite like a sex change\nFocus head space\n\n[Hook x2]\n\n[Verse 4: Fliptrix]\nIts like I'm standin' on the moon staring at the world\nTryna work out the balance of this life we hold\nIt's all a mystery encrypted in the Mayan scrolls\nThe cycle of the fifth sun is coming to a close\n2012 will only truly show us what that holds\nThe plot thickens as I stand here to break the mold\nGot my hands out, tryin' not to feel the cold\nBut some people walkin' by are fueled with an icy soul\nTools by they side, they take your life for your frigging phone\nOthers feel helpless, the selfless give a child a home\nRich feed the rich while the others just apply for loans\nMoney buys everything, but love that's the finest gold\nI gotta live fast and won't be dying barely old\nHedonistic lifestyles reflect how our lives unfold\nLife is one big cycle like the vinyl spinnin' round it goes\nAnd it goes\n\n[Verse 5: Jam Baxter]\nEquilibrium\nSee a billion desperate parts conjoined and deified brilliance\nGrand amphibians, submerged in slime\nEmerging like blood when blunt words collide\nThe sun burnt his eyes, the ice sliced his feet to bits\nBut you ain't gotta teach it shit\n'Cos the change is instinctual, the pace is unthinkable\nBut never put your faith in a fake individual\nBalance\nFrom the fangs and the mandibles and talons\nTo mannicles and batons to cannons\nTo mechanical contraptions, fashioned out of passion\nThat could turn the Earth back to a burnt black chasm\nShit happens\nAtoms, bound by compassion\nTo fractal patterns I saw spinning\nIn the caverns of my mind once, it all ties up\nIf I could see a bright sky shine when my eyes shut"}, {"Title": "What Happened", "Artist": "Dope D.O.D.", "Lyrics": "[Intro: Mulu]\nAyo, wassap, J.D.?

whose interests included raising hell, making enemies, and sticking nine-inch nails through each one of their eyelids. To commemorate Shady being set loose upon the world, we've decided to rank every single song Em has released to date\n\nBut first, allow us to qualify our countdown with a few rules of eligibility: We only included songs that were given an official retail release \u2014 that means tracks featured on studio albums, EPs, and compilations, plus guest verses; we didn't consult mixtapes or unofficial freestyles, so we offer our deepest apologies to \"Nail in the Coffin,\" \"Til Hell Freezes Over,\" and other noteworthy rarities. Skits weren't considered, either (condolences to all the Ken Kaniff and Steve Berman die-hards out there). Obviously, we only considered D12 tracks that featured a verse or hook from Eminem. And, finally, if there were multiple versions of a track, we opted to include the rendition we thought superior, so don't expect to see the live Grammy performance of \"Stan\" or The Slim Shady EP's \"Just the Two of Us.\" And with that, we begin the Eminem show...\n\n289. \"C'mon Let Me Ride\" (Skylar Grey feat.

(Yup)\nJust study a tape of N.W.A\nOne day I was walkin' by\nWith a Walkman on, when I caught a guy\nGave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)\nAnd strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani\nI don't give a fuck if it's dark or not\nI'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge\nWhen I'm drunk as fuck\nRight next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage\nHoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off\nFuck you too, bitch! Call the cops!\nI'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs\nAnd when the cops came through\nMe and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house\nWith a can full of gas and a hand full of matches\nAnd still weren't found out (Right here!)\nSo from here on out, it's the Chronic II\nStartin' today and tomorrow's anew\nAnd I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew\nChicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady\nHotter than a set of twin babies\nIn a Mercedes Benz with the windows up\nWhen the temp goes up to the mid-80s\nCallin' men ladies\nSorry Doc, but I been crazy\nThere's no way that you can save me\nIt's okay, go with him, Hailie (Dada?)\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nNowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say\nBut nothin' comes out when they move their lips\nJust a bunch of gibberish\nAnd motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre\nNowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say\nBut nothin' comes out when they move their lips\nJust a bunch of gibberish\nAnd motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre\n\n[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]\nIf it was up to me, you motherfuckers'd stop\nComin' up to me with your hands out\nLookin' up to me like you want somethin' free\nWhen my last CD was out, you weren't bumpin' me\nBut now that I got this little company\nEverybody wanna come to me\nLike it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me\n\u2018Cause I'm from the streets of C-Compton! (Compton!)\nI told 'em all\nAll 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?\nNow you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none\nWhat, you think I sold 'em all\n\u2018Cause I stay well off?\nNow all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off\nWhat, \u2018cause I been in the lab\nWith a pen and a pad tryin' to get this damn label off?\nI ain't havin' that\nThis is the millennium of Aftermath\nIt ain't gon' be nothin' after that\nSo give me one more platinum plaque\nAnd fuck rap, you can have it back\nSo where's all the Mad Rappers at?\nIt's like a jungle in this habitat\nBut all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats\nWhile you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nNowadays, everybody wanna talk\nLike they got somethin' to say\nBut nothin' comes out when they move their lips\nJust a bunch of gibberish\nAnd motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre\nNowadays, everybody wanna talk\nLike they got somethin' to say\nBut nothin' comes out when they move their lips\nJust a bunch of gibberish\nAnd motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre\n\n[Outro: Eminem]\nNowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say\nBut nothin' comes out when they move their lips\nJust a bunch of gibberish\nAnd motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre"}, {"Title": "Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)", "Artist": "Various Artists", "Lyrics": "Last updated: 10/6/2018, 5:16PM MST\nOctoberOctober 6Jesse Powell \u2014 Jesse Powell (1996)October 5girl in red \u2014 chapter 1 (2018)\nBlanca \u2014 Shattered (2018)\nLouGotCash (feat.

Chris Brown)", "Artist": "Kid Ink", "Lyrics": "Hi, I'm the Rap Critic, and\u2026 look, I know pop songs are typically lazily-written, blatantly sexual, and just the lowest common denominator when it comes to portraying any sort of intelligence, but this is just\u2026 okay, let's start from the beginning\n\nThis is Kid Ink. His main attribute is that he has tattoos. Like, a lot of tattoos. Other than that, he, uh\u2026 look, he's the new version of whoever had a hit song last year, but didn't stick around long. For all intents and purposes, he's j-kwon version 10 for the year 2014. And if you don't remember who J-Kwon is, well, that's exactly my point. So, here's Kid Ink's 2014 reimagining of the 4,348th song about being in the club and wanting to have sex with a girl, but\u2026 in the assembly line of mediocre pop/rap songs, something happened in the process that made this particular product defective.  and it starts with Chris Brown, who should be weaving one of those suggestive yet subtle pop song choruses that R and B singers are known for, right?\n\n\"Baby let me put your panties to the side (uh)\"\n\n\u2026.You know, that's romantic\u2026\n\nBut seriously, wow, talk about cutting to the chase. You know, most songs usually have some some sort of build up to an explicit lyric, some set up of some kind. Jeez, even Enrique Igacias at least begged her pardon first *\"Please excuse me, I don't mean to be rude\"* before saying, *\"But tonight, I'm fucking you\"* . But when you just kick off a song with \"Baby lemme put your panties to the side\" I can't help but feel like we skipped a few steps. It just seems a little contrary to the smooth R and B singer thing he's trying to pull off\n\n\"I'mma make you feel alright\n\u2018Cause I'mma give you what you need, yeah\"\n\nOkay, now we're back into the vague, obviously sexual but in no way descriptive style of songwriting that you guys are known for!\n\n\"Mami you remind me of something\nBut I don\u2019t know what it is (I don't know)\"\n\n\u2026.*amused, quick-off-and-back glance*\n\n\"You remind me of something (uh)\nBut I don\u2019t know what it is right now\"\n\n\u2026*chuckling* You've gotta be kidding me! Are you really gonna base the hook of this chorus around an unfinished pick up line?\n\n\"You remind me of something (uh)\nBut I don\u2019t know what it is right now\"\n\nDon't try to act like this is some slick turn of phrase, you sound like you just couldn't read what the songwriters gave you on the note pad!\n\n\"Mami you remind me of something\nBut I don\u2019t know what it is (I don't know)\"\n\nI don't know what\u2026 what is this trying to do?! Are you trying to pass off forgetfulness as sexy? You guys must think amnesia is downright titillating! no really, I wanna know the thought process behind this. Maybe, they realized how corny pick up line choruses were getting, especially after whole bedrock debacle, and thought they could do a Seinfeld-type one up move by comparing her to\u2026 nothing. Nah, that sounds too existential. Was this, maybe\u2026 some sort of homage to that old R. Kelly song?\n\n\"You remind me of something\nI just can't think of what it is\"\n\nBut wait, in THAT song, he immediately starts using comparisons\n\n\"You remind me of my jeep, I wanna ride it\nSomething like my sound, I wanna pump it\"\n\nSure, they're stupid comparisons, I mean, I don't think any woman wants to be compared to a jeep, if being compared to cars at all. I mean, if you were, why not something like a maserati, or a lamborghini, those are some sexy cars. In fact, I'm pretty sure there's an adult actress NAMED maserati, because that sounds cool. But, no girl would call herself a jeep. I mean look at this thing, it's bulky and asexual at best. You might as well call her a van. So, maybe they weren't referencing that song. Maybe this chorus was just completely improvised, and he just blurted out whatever came to mind first\n\n\"Hands in the air, looking' for a bitch right now\"\n\nYeah, that would explain a lot.. But wait, I didn't let the chorus continue, maybe there's something in there I forgot about. What does he say after that line?\n\n\"Cause you remind me of something (uh)\nGirl you gotta show me (alright) *looks confused*\nYou remind me of something (uh)\nBut I don\u2019t know what it is right now (I don't know)\nYou remind me of something (uh)\nGirl you gotta show me\"\n\nWait, so that's what you were doing? That was your ace in the hole? Trying to turn your absentmindedness into the reason why she should have sex with you? Look, when I hear a song where someone's talking to a member of the opposite sex, I usually imagine what it would translate to in real life. And when I hear this, this is the only way it translates to me:\n\n\"Girl, you remind of... of something, but I don't remember what it was\u2026 so why don't you remind me\u2026 by having sex with me\u2026\n\nAs far as I can imagine, there's just no way to make this sexy. Unless of course, you're a well-known celebrity, in which case, the chorus could be interpreted like this:\n\nGirl, you remind me of, um\u2026 of, uh\u2026*girl: uh-huh?*... look, I'm rich and famous and I want to have sex with you. Can we just skip to the part where we\u2026 *girl: yeah, sure\u2026* Alright, let's go\n\nAnd with the obvious \"You could never say something this stupid to a girl unless you're as rich as me\" mentality that this chorus has been written in, it pulls me out of the song immediately\u2026 and we haven't even gotten to the rapper yet!\n\nUh, on the real no lie\nI don\u2019t know what it is but you just my\u2026\n\nOkay, I see we're just gonna get the same obliviously stupid mannerisms that we've heard on the chorus. in fact, I don't even know why I'm bothering. It's obvious that I'm not going to get anything clever from this song\n\nGot a cup in your hand (hand)\nBaby sitting but you ain\u2019t got no kids\n\nRhyming \"hand\"\u2026. with \"kids\"\u2026 You know what? This song is already promised a VERY low rating because of Mr. Brown over here, so unless there's some great payoff to that crappy chorus, it's not redeeming itself. So, come on, let's skip ahead to the lyric that says what she reminds him of, because there's no way they'd set up such a chorus without some punchline SOMEWHERE\n\nWe ain\u2019t leaving \u2019til there ain\u2019t no more left (yeah)\nCan\u2019t see no time on the Rolex\n\nYeah, yeah, your watch has so many diamonds, you can't see the time, everyone's said it, and you're not special. Keep going\n\nGo on the floor like a doormat (uh)\nBaby you know where to throw that\n\nWait\u2026 is that what she reminds him of, a doormat? Because she \"goes on the floor\"? Well, I hope not, because\u2026 calling a person a doormat, has\u2026 a bit of a negative connotation to it, so this can't be it, let's\u2026 keep going\n\nUh, so tell me what your name is\nI don\u2019t really care who you came with (no)\n\nNope, he doesn't bring\u2026 really, now? Is that what you're going to say to her?\n\n\"So, girl, what's your name?\"\n\"Well, I'm Kiesha, I just came with my best friends\u2026\"\n\"Haha, I don't care\u2026\"\n\nUnless you got a couple friends look like you\n\n\"That is, unless of course, your friends are hot, because then I'll want to have sex with them, too\u2026 and\u2026 by openly telling you this, I'm assuming it won't be a problem, because, I mean, when has a girl ever been jealous when a guy tries to talk to other women?\n\nMy bad if my ex try to fight you\n\nOh yeah\u2026\n\nOkay, I'm sick of this, and the way he thinks chatting up girls at the bar works is not helping, but that chorus still frustrates me, so I want to get to the point: what is the thing that she reminds him of? I have to know\n\nYou remind me of\u2026\n\nOh, here it is! Here's the thing she reminds him of! All will be revealed!\n\nYou remind me of something missing\nMisses, you got my full attention\n\nSo\u2026 she reminds him of\u2026 something missing, like in his life, which is a \"mrs.\", a spouse, a loving companion\u2026 WHAT A LOAD OF HORSE SHIT\n\nSo, this song was building up to him telling her she was wifey material? Oh, I'm sorry, maybe the fact that you were talking about pulling her panties to the side 2 minutes before you even asked what her freaking name was kinda threw me off!\n\nThis gets a 0 out of 5. It's crap. These lyrics are horrendously irredeemable, from the word go. The very first line of the chorus socks you with a bad taste in your mouth, and what follows are a bunch of lines that NO ONE would get away with in real life, so there's no connection you could make with it. The problem is that the way the chorus is written, with forgetting what he was going to say, sounds like it should have been played for laughs. But it's not. They wanted you to take that seriously as a slick pick-up line, There's nothing smooth about what he said, and there's nothing cool about it. It sounds like it was written by a bunch of jackasses who have no idea how human interaction works, and I just can't deal with it\n\nI'm the Rap Critic: you don't have to like my opinion, but man, fuck this song..."}, {"Title": "Doing It Wrong", "Artist": "Drake", "Lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nWhen a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world\nIt's just the end of a world that you had with one girl\nAnd she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting\nAnd it's all because she don't want things to change\n\n[Chorus]\nSo cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you\nThat's the wrong thing to do\nTouch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you\nThat's the wrong thing to do\nTalk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you\nThat's the wrong thing to do\nCause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying\nAnd say I love you, too\n\n[Bridge]\nBut I need someone different\nYou know it, oh ho, you know it\nOh ho, you know it, we both know it\nI need someone different\nYou know it, oh ho, you know it\nOh ho, you know it, we both know it\nSomething's been missing\nYou know it, oh ho, she knows it\nOh ho, I know it, we all know it\nI need someone different\n(Oh ho, oh ho)\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe live in a generation of not being in love\nAnd not being together\nBut we sure make it feel like we're together\nBecause we're scared to see each other with somebody else\n\n[Chorus]\nSo cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you\nThat's the wrong thing to do\nTouch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you\nThat's the wrong thing to do\nTalk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you\nThat's the wrong thing to do\nCause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying\nAnd say I love you, too\n\n[Bridge]\nBut I need someone different\nYou know it, oh ho, you know it\nOh ho, you know it, we both know it\nI need someone different\nYou know it, oh ho, you know it\nOh ho, you know it, we both know it\nSomething's been missing\nYou know it, oh ho, she knows it\nOh ho, I know it, we all know it\nI need someone different\n(Oh ho, oh ho)\n\n[Outro: Stevie Wonder on Harmonica]"}, {"Title": "Marvins Room", "Artist": "Drake", "Lyrics": "[Intro: Ericka Lee]\nHello?

strolled off\nLookin' at them legs, god damn they looked so soft (So fine)\nI gotta take ya from your man that's my mission\nIf his love is real he got ta handle competition\nYou only knew him five months (That's right)\nBesides, he drink too much and smoke too many blunts\nAnd I be workin' out everyday thinkin' bout you\nLooking at my own eyes in the rear view\nCatchin flash backs of our eye

tongue, girl, all night\nI wonder one day could it be, simple dreams turnin' into reality\nOur love would come down so naturally\nWe would walk down the aisle of destiny\nWhat your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared\nBreak ya off a little chump change to do your hair\nThat seems to be enough to satisfy your needs\nBut there's a deeper level if you just follow my lead\nHey lover\n\n[Chorus:

touched you gently with my hands\nWe talked about travelin' the distant lands\nEscapin' all the madness out here in the world\nBecomin' my wife, no longer my girl\nThen, you let your dress fall down to the floor\nI kissed you softly and you yearned for more\nWe experienced pleasure unparallel\nInto an ocean of love, we both fell\nSwimmin' in the timeless, currents of pure bliss\nFantasies interchangin' with each kiss\nUndyin' passion unities our souls\nTogether we swim until the point of no control, but\nIt's a fantasy it (that, you) won't come true\nWe never even spoke and your man

Christ-like\nNigga I ain't psychic\nI know it's all a cycle and everybody bike it\nAnd France is enormous you're Lance with endorsements\nBut you might need a hand to enhance your performance\nConsider this a kilogram of encouragement\nTeach you how to sneak it past the enforcement\nAnd when you get it through in a manner so cool\nRemember to give a little nod to the old school\nWassup...\n\n[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]\nGive me your old school love right now\nI'm leaving it all up to you darling, giving you everything you want\nAnd give me that old school love right now\nYou know that only you and me alone...\n\n[Hook: Ed Sheeran]\nAs long as I'm here, as long as you love me\nGive me that old school love right now\nAs long as I'm here, as long as you love me\nGive me that old school love right now"}, {"Title": "So Sick", "Artist": "Kurt Hugo Schneider", "Lyrics": "Adele -

(When you take out your braids)\nDoes she know that you like to play PS2 'til 6 in the morning like I do?\n\n[Chorus: Paula DeAnda & Divine]\nI can't explain this feeling (Yeah)\nI think about it every day\nAnd even though we've moved on (Uh-huh)\nIt gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)\nWalk away (Forever you will live in my memory)\nWalk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)\nWalk away (I can't forget how we used to be)\n\n[Verse 3: Paula DeAnda]\nGuess I gotta live my life from day to day\nHoping maybe you'll come back\nAnd though I tell myself not to be afraid\nTo move on, but it seems I can't\nThough a new man has given me attention\nIt ain't the same as your affection\nThough I know I should be content\nIn the back of my mind, I can't help but question\nDoes he kiss me on the forehead? (Before we play)\nShow up on my doorstep? (With a bouquet)\nDoes he call me in the middle of the day just to say, \"Baby, I love you\" (Like you used to?)\n\n[Chorus: Paula DeAnda & Divine]\nI can't explain this feeling (Yeah)\nI think about it every day\nAnd even though we've moved on (Uh-huh)\nIt gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)\nWalk away (Forever you will live in my memory)\nWalk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)\nWalk away (I can't forget how we used to be)\n\n[Verse 4: Divine, Paula DeAnda, Both]\nI'm gonna remember you (You're gonna remember me)\nThe things we did, the way we shared our fantasies\nJust you and me; my friend, my love, my family\nHow did we lose a love that seemed meant to be?\nSometimes I kiss her and wish that it was you I'm kissing\nSometimes I miss him and wish that it was you I'm missing\nSometimes I hug her and wish that it was you I was hugging\nAnd I realize how much I'm bugging\nI miss you\n\n[Bridge: Paula DeAnda & Divine]\nSo hard to express this feeling\n'Cause nobody compares to you (To you)\nAnd you know she'll never love you like I do (Yeah)\n\n[Chorus: Paula DeAnda, Divine, Both]\nI can't explain this feeling (Uh-uh)\nI think about it every day (Yeah)\nAnd even though we've moved on (Yeah)\nIt gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me) (Walk away)\nWalk away (Walk away)\nWalk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me) (I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, no...)\nI can't explain this feeling (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)\nI think about it every day (Forever you will live in my memory)\nAnd even though we've moved on (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)\nIt gets so hard to walk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)\nWalk away (Forever you will live in my memory) (?)\nWalk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember me)\nWalk away (I'm gonna remember you, you're gonna remember
